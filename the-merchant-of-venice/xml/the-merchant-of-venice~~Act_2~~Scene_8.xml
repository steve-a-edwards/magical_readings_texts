<h3>SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter SALARINO and SALANIO</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">With him is Gratiano gone along;</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">He came too late, the ship was under sail:</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">But there the duke was given to understand</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">That in a gondola were seen together</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Besides, Antonio certified the duke</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">I never heard a passion so confused,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">So strange, outrageous, and so variable,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="23">Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="25">Let good Antonio look he keep his day,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Or he shall pay for this.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">Marry, well remember'd.</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Who told me, in the narrow seas that part</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">The French and English, there miscarried</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">A vessel of our country richly fraught:</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">I thought upon Antonio when he told me;</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">And wish'd in silence that it were not his.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="34">You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">Bassanio told him he would make some speed</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">But stay the very riping of the time;</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">Let it not enter in your mind of love:</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">To courtship and such fair ostents of love</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">As shall conveniently become you there:'</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">And even there, his eye being big with tears,</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">And with affection wondrous sensible</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="51">I think he only loves the world for him.</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">I pray thee, let us go and find him out</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">And quicken his embraced heaviness</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">With some delight or other.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="55">Do we so.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
