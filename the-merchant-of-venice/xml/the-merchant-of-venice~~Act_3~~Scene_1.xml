<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter SALANIO and SALARINO</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Now, what news on the Rialto?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">Report be an honest woman of her word.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">wept for the death of a third husband. But it is</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">to keep his name company!--</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="15">Come, the full stop.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="16">Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">lost a ship.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="18">I would it might prove the end of his losses.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="19">Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter SHYLOCK</i></p>
<a NAME="21">How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">daughter's flight.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="24">That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">that made the wings she flew withal.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="26">And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">to leave the dam.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="29">She is damned for it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="30">That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">My own flesh and blood to rebel!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="33">I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="34">There is more difference between thy flesh and hers</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">than there is between red wine and rhenish. But</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">loss at sea or no?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="39">There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">look to his bond.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="46">Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">his flesh: what's that good for?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="48">To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">to the same diseases, healed by the same means,</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">will better the instruction.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter a Servant</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="69">Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">desires to speak with you both.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="71">We have been up and down to seek him.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter TUBAL</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="72">Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="74">How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">found my daughter?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="76">I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="77">Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in</a><br/>
<a NAME="84">her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:</a><br/>
<a NAME="88">nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">but of my shedding.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="91">Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">heard in Genoa,--</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="93">What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="94">Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="95">I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="96">I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="97">I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">ha, ha! where? in Genoa?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="99">Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">night fourscore ducats.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="101">Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my</a><br/>
<a NAME="102">gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">fourscore ducats!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="104">There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech35"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="106">I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">him: I am glad of it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="108">One of them showed me a ring that he had of your</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">daughter for a monkey.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech37"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="110">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech38"><b>TUBAL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="113">But Antonio is certainly undone.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech39"><b>SHYLOCK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="114">Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I</a><br/>
<a NAME="118">will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
