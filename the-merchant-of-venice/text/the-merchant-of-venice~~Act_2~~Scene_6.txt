_S_SCENE VI. The same.
_D_Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued
_R_GRATIANO
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.
_R_SALARINO
His hour is almost past.
_R_GRATIANO
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.
_R_SALARINO
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
_R_GRATIANO
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like the prodigal doth she return,
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
_R_SALARINO
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
_D_Enter LORENZO
_R_LORENZO
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
_D_Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes
_R_JESSICA
Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
_R_LORENZO
Lorenzo, and thy love.
_R_JESSICA
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
_R_LORENZO
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
_R_JESSICA
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.
_R_LORENZO
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
_R_JESSICA
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.
_R_LORENZO
So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
_R_JESSICA
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
_D_Exit above
_R_GRATIANO
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
_R_LORENZO
Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
_D_Enter JESSICA, below
_D_Exit with Jessica and Salarino
_D_Enter ANTONIO
_R_ANTONIO
Who's there?
_R_GRATIANO
Signior Antonio!
_R_ANTONIO
Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
_R_GRATIANO
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
_D_Exeunt
