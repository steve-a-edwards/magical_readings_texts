_S_SCENE II. The same. A street.
_D_Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
_R_PORTIA
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
_D_Enter GRATIANO
_R_GRATIANO
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.
_R_PORTIA
That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
_R_GRATIANO
That will I do.
_R_NERISSA
Sir, I would speak with you.
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
_D_Aside to PORTIA
_R_PORTIA
[Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
_D_Aloud
_R_NERISSA
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
_D_Exeunt
