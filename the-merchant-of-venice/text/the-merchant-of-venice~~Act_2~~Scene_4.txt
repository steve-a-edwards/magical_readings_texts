_S_SCENE IV. The same. A street.
_D_Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
_R_LORENZO
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.
_R_GRATIANO
We have not made good preparation.
_R_SALARINO
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
_R_SALANIO
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
And better in my mind not undertook.
_R_LORENZO
'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us.
_D_Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
_R_LAUNCELOT
An it shall please you to break up
this, it shall seem to signify.
_R_LORENZO
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.
_R_GRATIANO
Love-news, in faith.
_R_LAUNCELOT
By your leave, sir.
_R_LORENZO
Whither goest thou?
_R_LAUNCELOT
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
_R_LORENZO
Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,
_D_Exit Launcelot
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.
_R_SALANIO
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
_R_SALANIO
And so will I.
_R_LORENZO
Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
_R_SALARINO
'Tis good we do so.
_D_Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO
_R_GRATIANO
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
_R_LORENZO
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
_D_Exeunt
