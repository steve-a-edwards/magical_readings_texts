_S_SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.
_D_Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
_R_OLIVIA
I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
I speak too loud.
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
Where is Malvolio?
_R_MARIA
He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
is, sure, possessed, madam.
_R_OLIVIA
Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
_R_MARIA
No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
_R_OLIVIA
Go call him hither.
_D_Exit MARIA
I am as mad as he,
If sad and merry madness equal be.
_D_Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
How now, Malvolio!
_R_MALVOLIO
Sweet lady, ho, ho.
_R_OLIVIA
Smilest thou?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
_R_MALVOLIO
Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
please all.'
_R_OLIVIA
Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
_R_MALVOLIO
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
did come to his hands, and commands shall be
executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
_R_OLIVIA
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
_R_MALVOLIO
To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
_R_OLIVIA
God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
thy hand so oft?
_R_MARIA
How do you, Malvolio?
_R_MALVOLIO
At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
_R_MARIA
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
_R_MALVOLIO
'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
_R_OLIVIA
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
_R_MALVOLIO
'Some are born great,'--
_R_OLIVIA
Ha!
_R_MALVOLIO
'Some achieve greatness,'--
_R_OLIVIA
What sayest thou?
_R_MALVOLIO
'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
_R_OLIVIA
Heaven restore thee!
_R_MALVOLIO
'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--
_R_OLIVIA
Thy yellow stockings!
_R_MALVOLIO
'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
_R_OLIVIA
Cross-gartered!
_R_MALVOLIO
'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
_R_OLIVIA
Am I made?
_R_MALVOLIO
'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
_R_OLIVIA
Why, this is very midsummer madness.
_D_Enter Servant
_R_Servant
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
attends your ladyship's pleasure.
_R_OLIVIA
I'll come to him.
_D_Exit Servant
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
half of my dowry.
_D_Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
_R_MALVOLIO
O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
that can be can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
_D_Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
_R_FABIAN
Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
how is't with you, man?
_R_MALVOLIO
Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
off.
_R_MARIA
Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
care of him.
_R_MALVOLIO
Ah, ha! does she so?
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
_R_MALVOLIO
Do you know what you say?
_R_MARIA
La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
_R_FABIAN
Carry his water to the wise woman.
_R_MARIA
Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
_R_MALVOLIO
How now, mistress!
_R_MARIA
O Lord!
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
_R_FABIAN
No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
rough, and will not be roughly used.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
_R_MALVOLIO
Sir!
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
him, foul collier!
_R_MARIA
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
_R_MALVOLIO
My prayers, minx!
_R_MARIA
No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
_R_MALVOLIO
Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
things: I am not of your element: you shall know
more hereafter.
_D_Exit
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Is't possible?
_R_FABIAN
If this were played upon a stage now, I could
condemn it as an improbable fiction.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
_R_MARIA
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
_R_FABIAN
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
_R_MARIA
The house will be the quieter.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
finder of madmen. But see, but see.
_D_Enter SIR ANDREW
_R_FABIAN
More matter for a May morning.
_R_SIR ANDREW
Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
vinegar and pepper in't.
_R_FABIAN
Is't so saucy?
_R_SIR ANDREW
Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Give me.
_D_Reads
'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
_R_FABIAN
Good, and valiant.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
_R_FABIAN
A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
_R_FABIAN
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
be thy chance to kill me,'--
_R_FABIAN
Good.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
_R_FABIAN
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
I'll give't him.
_R_MARIA
You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
more approbation than ever proof itself would have
earned him. Away!
_R_SIR ANDREW
Nay, let me alone for swearing.
_D_Exit
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
capacity and breeding; his employment between his
lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
This will so fright them both that they will kill
one another by the look, like cockatrices.
_D_Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA
_R_FABIAN
Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
he take leave, and presently after him.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
for a challenge.
_D_Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA
_R_OLIVIA
I have said too much unto a heart of stone
And laid mine honour too unchary out:
There's something in me that reproves my fault;
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
That it but mocks reproof.
_R_VIOLA
With the same 'havior that your passion bears
Goes on my master's grief.
_R_OLIVIA
Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
That honour saved may upon asking give?
_R_VIOLA
Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
_R_OLIVIA
How with mine honour may I give him that
Which I have given to you?
_R_VIOLA
I will acquit you.
_R_OLIVIA
Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
_D_Exit
_D_Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Gentleman, God save thee.
_R_VIOLA
And you, sir.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
_R_VIOLA
You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
any image of offence done to any man.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
_R_VIOLA
I pray you, sir, what is he?
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
_R_VIOLA
I will return again into the house and desire some
conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
of that quirk.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
house, unless you undertake that with me which with
as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
_R_VIOLA
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
my offence to him is: it is something of my
negligence, nothing of my purpose.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
gentleman till my return.
_D_Exit
_R_VIOLA
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
_R_FABIAN
I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
_R_VIOLA
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
_R_FABIAN
Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
can.
_R_VIOLA
I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
care not who knows so much of my mettle.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
_R_SIR ANDREW
Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
scarce hold him yonder.
_R_SIR ANDREW
Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
_D_Aside
Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
_D_Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
_D_To FABIAN
I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
_R_FABIAN
He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
[To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
_R_VIOLA
[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
_R_FABIAN
Give ground, if you see him furious.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
_R_SIR ANDREW
Pray God, he keep his oath!
_R_VIOLA
I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
_D_They draw
_D_Enter ANTONIO
_R_ANTONIO
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
If you offend him, I for him defy you.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
You, sir! why, what are you?
_R_ANTONIO
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
_D_They draw
_D_Enter Officers
_R_FABIAN
O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
I'll be with you anon.
_R_VIOLA
Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
_R_SIR ANDREW
Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
and reins well.
_R_First Officer
This is the man; do thy office.
_R_Second Officer
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
_R_ANTONIO
You do mistake me, sir.
_R_First Officer
No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
Take him away: he knows I know him well.
_R_ANTONIO
I must obey.
_D_To VIOLA
This comes with seeking you:
But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
What will you do, now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
Much more for what I cannot do for you
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
But be of comfort.
_R_Second Officer
Come, sir, away.
_R_ANTONIO
I must entreat of you some of that money.
_R_VIOLA
What money, sir?
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
Out of my lean and low ability
I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
I'll make division of my present with you:
Hold, there's half my coffer.
_R_ANTONIO
Will you deny me now?
Is't possible that my deserts to you
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
Lest that it make me so unsound a man
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
That I have done for you.
_R_VIOLA
I know of none;
Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
I hate ingratitude more in a man
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
Inhabits our frail blood.
_R_ANTONIO
O heavens themselves!
_R_Second Officer
Come, sir, I pray you, go.
_R_ANTONIO
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
And to his image, which methought did promise
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
_R_First Officer
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
_R_ANTONIO
But O how vile an idol proves this god
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
_R_First Officer
The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
_R_ANTONIO
Lead me on.
_D_Exit with Officers
_R_VIOLA
Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
That he believes himself: so do not I.
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
_R_VIOLA
He named Sebastian: I my brother know
Yet living in my glass; even such and so
In favour was my brother, and he went
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
_D_Exit
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
his cowardship, ask Fabian.
_R_FABIAN
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
_R_SIR ANDREW
'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
_R_SIR ANDREW
An I do not,--
_R_FABIAN
Come, let's see the event.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
_D_Exeunt
