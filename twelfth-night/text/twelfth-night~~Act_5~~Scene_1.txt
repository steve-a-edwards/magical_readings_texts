_S_SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
_D_Enter Clown and FABIAN
_R_FABIAN
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
_R_Clown
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
_R_FABIAN
Any thing.
_R_Clown
Do not desire to see this letter.
_R_FABIAN
This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
dog again.
_D_Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
_R_Clown
Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
_R_Clown
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
for my friends.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
_R_Clown
No, sir, the worse.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
How can that be?
_R_Clown
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
my friends and the better for my foes.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Why, this is excellent.
_R_Clown
By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
one of my friends.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
_R_Clown
But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
you could make it another.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
O, you give me ill counsel.
_R_Clown
Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
and let your flesh and blood obey it.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
double-dealer: there's another.
_R_Clown
Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
my bounty further.
_R_Clown
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
will awake it anon.
_D_Exit
_R_VIOLA
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
_D_Enter ANTONIO and Officers
_R_DUKE ORSINO
That face of his I do remember well;
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
With which such scathful grapple did he make
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
That very envy and the tongue of loss
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
_R_First Officer
Orsino, this is that Antonio
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
And this is he that did the Tiger board,
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
In private brabble did we apprehend him.
_R_VIOLA
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
I know not what 'twas but distraction.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
Hast made thine enemies?
_R_ANTONIO
Orsino, noble sir,
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love, without retention or restraint,
All his in dedication; for his sake
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
Into the danger of this adverse town;
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before.
_R_VIOLA
How can this be?
_R_DUKE ORSINO
When came he to this town?
_R_ANTONIO
To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
Both day and night did we keep company.
_D_Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
But more of that anon. Take him aside.
_R_OLIVIA
What would my lord, but that he may not have,
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
_R_VIOLA
Madam!
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Gracious Olivia,--
_R_OLIVIA
What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
_R_VIOLA
My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
_R_OLIVIA
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Still so cruel?
_R_OLIVIA
Still so constant, lord.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
_R_OLIVIA
Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
And that I partly know the instrument
That screws me from my true place in your favour,
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
_R_VIOLA
And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
_R_OLIVIA
Where goes Cesario?
_R_VIOLA
After him I love
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above
Punish my life for tainting of my love!
_R_OLIVIA
Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
_R_VIOLA
Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
_R_OLIVIA
Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Call forth the holy father.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Come, away!
_R_OLIVIA
Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Husband!
_R_OLIVIA
Ay, husband: can he that deny?
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Her husband, sirrah!
_R_VIOLA
No, my lord, not I.
_R_OLIVIA
Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
As great as that thou fear'st.
_D_Enter Priest
O, welcome, father!
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
Here to unfold, though lately we intended
To keep in darkness what occasion now
Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
_R_Priest
A contract of eternal bond of love,
Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
Attested by the holy close of lips,
Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
And all the ceremony of this compact
Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
I have travell'd but two hours.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
_R_VIOLA
My lord, I do protest--
_R_OLIVIA
O, do not swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
_D_Enter SIR ANDREW
_R_SIR ANDREW
For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
to Sir Toby.
_R_OLIVIA
What's the matter?
_R_SIR ANDREW
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
_R_OLIVIA
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
_R_SIR ANDREW
The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
My gentleman, Cesario?
_R_SIR ANDREW
'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
by Sir Toby.
_R_VIOLA
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
You drew your sword upon me without cause;
But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
_R_SIR ANDREW
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
_D_Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
but if he had not been in drink, he would have
tickled you othergates than he did.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
_R_Clown
O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
were set at eight i' the morning.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
hate a drunken rogue.
_R_OLIVIA
Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
_R_SIR ANDREW
I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
_R_SIR TOBY BELCH
Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
_R_OLIVIA
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
_D_Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
_D_Enter SEBASTIAN
_R_SEBASTIAN
I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
But, had it been the brother of my blood,
I must have done no less with wit and safety.
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
I do perceive it hath offended you:
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
A natural perspective, that is and is not!
_R_SEBASTIAN
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
Since I have lost thee!
_R_ANTONIO
Sebastian are you?
_R_SEBASTIAN
Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
_R_ANTONIO
How have you made division of yourself?
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
_R_OLIVIA
Most wonderful!
_R_SEBASTIAN
Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
Of here and every where. I had a sister,
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman? what name? what parentage?
_R_VIOLA
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
So went he suited to his watery tomb:
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us.
_R_SEBASTIAN
A spirit I am indeed;
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate.
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
_R_VIOLA
My father had a mole upon his brow.
_R_SEBASTIAN
And so had mine.
_R_VIOLA
And died that day when Viola from her birth
Had number'd thirteen years.
_R_SEBASTIAN
O, that record is lively in my soul!
He finished indeed his mortal act
That day that made my sister thirteen years.
_R_VIOLA
If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
That I am Viola: which to confirm,
I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
I was preserved to serve this noble count.
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord.
_R_SEBASTIAN
[To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid;
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
_D_To VIOLA
Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
_R_VIOLA
And all those sayings will I overswear;
And those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Give me thy hand;
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
_R_VIOLA
The captain that did bring me first on shore
Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
_R_OLIVIA
He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
And yet, alas, now I remember me,
They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
_D_Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
How does he, sirrah?
_R_Clown
Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
so it skills not much when they are delivered.
_R_OLIVIA
Open't, and read it.
_R_Clown
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
the madman.
_D_Reads
'By the Lord, madam,'--
_R_OLIVIA
How now! art thou mad?
_R_Clown
No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
_R_OLIVIA
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
_R_Clown
So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
_R_OLIVIA
Read it you, sirrah.
_D_To FABIAN
_R_FABIAN
[Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
world shall know it: though you have put me into
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury.
THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
_R_OLIVIA
Did he write this?
_R_Clown
Ay, madam.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
This savours not much of distraction.
_R_OLIVIA
See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
_D_Exit FABIAN
My lord so please you, these things further
thought on,
To think me as well a sister as a wife,
One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
Here at my house and at my proper cost.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
_D_To VIOLA
Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
So much against the mettle of your sex,
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
And since you call'd me master for so long,
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
Your master's mistress.
_R_OLIVIA
A sister! you are she.
_D_Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Is this the madman?
_R_OLIVIA
Ay, my lord, this same.
How now, Malvolio!
_R_MALVOLIO
Madam, you have done me wrong,
Notorious wrong.
_R_OLIVIA
Have I, Malvolio? no.
_R_MALVOLIO
Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
You must not now deny it is your hand:
Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
You can say none of this: well, grant it then
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
And, acting this in an obedient hope,
Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
And made the most notorious geck and gull
That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
_R_OLIVIA
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
Though, I confess, much like the character
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
And now I do bethink me, it was she
First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
And in such forms which here were presupposed
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Of thine own cause.
_R_FABIAN
Good madam, hear me speak,
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Taint the condition of this present hour,
Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
Set this device against Malvolio here,
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
In recompense whereof he hath married her.
How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
That have on both sides pass'd.
_R_OLIVIA
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
_R_Clown
Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
_R_MALVOLIO
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
_D_Exit
_R_OLIVIA
He hath been most notoriously abused.
_R_DUKE ORSINO
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
He hath not told us of the captain yet:
When that is known and golden time convents,
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
For so you shall be, while you are a man;
But when in other habits you are seen,
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
_D_Exeunt all, except Clown
_R_Clown
[Sings]
When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came to man's estate,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
For the rain it raineth every day
But when I came, alas! to wive,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
By swaggering could I never thrive,
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came unto my beds,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
For the rain it raineth every day.
A great while ago the world begun,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
But that's all one, our play is done,
And we'll strive to please you every day.
_D_Exit
