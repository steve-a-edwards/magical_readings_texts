<h3>SCENE II. The sea-coast.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">What country, friends, is this?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">This is Illyria, lady.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">And what should I do in Illyria?</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">My brother he is in Elysium.</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">When you and those poor number saved with you</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">Most provident in peril, bind himself,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">So long as I could see.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="18">For saying so, there's gold:</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">The like of him. Know'st thou this country?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">Not three hours' travel from this very place.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="24">Who governs here?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="25">A noble duke, in nature as in name.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="26">What is the name?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">Orsino.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="28">Orsino! I have heard my father name him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">He was a bachelor then.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="30">And so is now, or was so very late;</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">For but a month ago I went from hence,</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">What great ones do the less will prattle of,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="35">What's she?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">In the protection of his son, her brother,</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">They say, she hath abjured the company</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">And sight of men.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="42">                  O that I served that lady</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">And might not be delivered to the world,</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">What my estate is!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="46">That were hard to compass;</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">Because she will admit no kind of suit,</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">No, not the duke's.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="49">There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">And though that nature with a beauteous wall</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">With this thy fair and outward character.</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">For such disguise as haply shall become</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">And speak to him in many sorts of music</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">That will allow me very worth his service.</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">What else may hap to time I will commit;</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="64">Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>VIOLA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="66">I thank thee: lead me on.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
