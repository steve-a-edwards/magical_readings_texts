<h3>SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter SEBASTIAN</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>SEBASTIAN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">This is the air; that is the glorious sun;</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">I could not find him at the Elephant:</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">That he did range the town to seek me out.</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">His counsel now might do me golden service;</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">For though my soul disputes well with my sense,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">That this may be some error, but no madness,</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">That I am ready to distrust mine eyes</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">And wrangle with my reason that persuades me</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">To any other trust but that I am mad</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">She could not sway her house, command her followers,</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Take and give back affairs and their dispatch</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">As I perceive she does: there's something in't</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter OLIVIA and Priest</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>OLIVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">Now go with me and with this holy man</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Into the chantry by: there, before him,</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">And underneath that consecrated roof,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Plight me the full assurance of your faith;</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">That my most jealous and too doubtful soul</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">May live at peace. He shall conceal it</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">What time we will our celebration keep</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">According to my birth. What do you say?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>SEBASTIAN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">I'll follow this good man, and go with you;</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>OLIVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="34">Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">That they may fairly note this act of mine!</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
