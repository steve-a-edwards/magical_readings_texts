<h3>SCENE II. A public place.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Calpurnia!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">Calpurnia!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>CALPURNIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">Here, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="5">Stand you directly in Antonius' way,</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">When he doth run his course. Antonius!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Caesar, my lord?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">The barren, touched in this holy chase,</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">Shake off their sterile curse.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">I shall remember:</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="14">Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</a><br/>
<p><i>Flourish</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>Soothsayer</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="15">Caesar!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="16">Ha! who calls?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="18">Who is it in the press that calls on me?</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>Soothsayer</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="21">Beware the ides of March.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">What man is that?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="23">A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="24">Set him before me; let me see his face.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="25">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="26">What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>Soothsayer</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">Beware the ides of March.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="28">He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</a><br/>
<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="29">Will you go see the order of the course?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="30">Not I.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">I pray you, do.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">I'll leave you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">I have not from your eyes that gentleness</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">And show of love as I was wont to have:</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">Over your friend that loves you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="41">Cassius,</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">I turn the trouble of my countenance</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">Of late with passions of some difference,</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">Conceptions only proper to myself,</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">Nor construe any further my neglect,</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">Forgets the shows of love to other men.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="53">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="57">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">But by reflection, by some other things.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="59">'Tis just:</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">That you have no such mirrors as will turn</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Where many of the best respect in Rome,</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="68">Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">That you would have me seek into myself</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">For that which is not in me?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="71">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">And since you know you cannot see yourself</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">Will modestly discover to yourself</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">That of yourself which you yet know not of.</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</a><br/>
<a NAME="77">Were I a common laugher, or did use</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">To stale with ordinary oaths my love</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">To every new protester; if you know</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">And after scandal them, or if you know</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">That I profess myself in banqueting</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</a><br/>
<p><i>Flourish, and shout</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">Choose Caesar for their king.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="86">Ay, do you fear it?</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">Then must I think you would not have it so.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech35"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="88">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">What is it that you would impart to me?</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">If it be aught toward the general good,</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</a><br/>
<a NAME="93">And I will look on both indifferently,</a><br/>
<a NAME="94">For let the gods so speed me as I love</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">The name of honour more than I fear death.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="96">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</a><br/>
<a NAME="97">As well as I do know your outward favour.</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">Well, honour is the subject of my story.</a><br/>
<a NAME="99">I cannot tell what you and other men</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">Think of this life; but, for my single self,</a><br/>
<a NAME="101">I had as lief not be as live to be</a><br/>
<a NAME="102">In awe of such a thing as I myself.</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">We both have fed as well, and we can both</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</a><br/>
<a NAME="108">Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">Leap in with me into this angry flood,</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</a><br/>
<a NAME="118">I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</a><br/>
<a NAME="120">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</a><br/>
<a NAME="121">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</a><br/>
<a NAME="122">Is now become a god, and Cassius is</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">A wretched creature and must bend his body,</a><br/>
<a NAME="124">If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</a><br/>
<a NAME="125">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">And when the fit was on him, I did mark</a><br/>
<a NAME="127">How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="129">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</a><br/>
<a NAME="131">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</a><br/>
<a NAME="132">Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</a><br/>
<a NAME="133">Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</a><br/>
<a NAME="134">As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">A man of such a feeble temper should</a><br/>
<a NAME="136">So get the start of the majestic world</a><br/>
<a NAME="137">And bear the palm alone.</a><br/>
<p><i>Shout. Flourish</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech37"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="138">Another general shout!</a><br/>
<a NAME="139">I do believe that these applauses are</a><br/>
<a NAME="140">For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech38"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="141">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</a><br/>
<a NAME="142">Like a Colossus, and we petty men</a><br/>
<a NAME="143">Walk under his huge legs and peep about</a><br/>
<a NAME="144">To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</a><br/>
<a NAME="145">Men at some time are masters of their fates:</a><br/>
<a NAME="146">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</a><br/>
<a NAME="147">But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</a><br/>
<a NAME="148">Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</a><br/>
<a NAME="149">Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</a><br/>
<a NAME="150">Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</a><br/>
<a NAME="151">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</a><br/>
<a NAME="152">Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</a><br/>
<a NAME="153">Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</a><br/>
<a NAME="154">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</a><br/>
<a NAME="155">Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="156">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</a><br/>
<a NAME="157">Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</a><br/>
<a NAME="158">When went there by an age, since the great flood,</a><br/>
<a NAME="159">But it was famed with more than with one man?</a><br/>
<a NAME="160">When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</a><br/>
<a NAME="161">That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</a><br/>
<a NAME="162">Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</a><br/>
<a NAME="163">When there is in it but one only man.</a><br/>
<a NAME="164">O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</a><br/>
<a NAME="165">There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="166">The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</a><br/>
<a NAME="167">As easily as a king.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech39"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="168">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</a><br/>
<a NAME="169">What you would work me to, I have some aim:</a><br/>
<a NAME="170">How I have thought of this and of these times,</a><br/>
<a NAME="171">I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</a><br/>
<a NAME="172">I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</a><br/>
<a NAME="173">Be any further moved. What you have said</a><br/>
<a NAME="174">I will consider; what you have to say</a><br/>
<a NAME="175">I will with patience hear, and find a time</a><br/>
<a NAME="176">Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</a><br/>
<a NAME="177">Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</a><br/>
<a NAME="178">Brutus had rather be a villager</a><br/>
<a NAME="179">Than to repute himself a son of Rome</a><br/>
<a NAME="180">Under these hard conditions as this time</a><br/>
<a NAME="181">Is like to lay upon us.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech40"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="182">I am glad that my weak words</a><br/>
<a NAME="183">Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech41"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="184">The games are done and Caesar is returning.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech42"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="185">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</a><br/>
<a NAME="186">And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</a><br/>
<a NAME="187">What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</a><br/>
<p><i>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech43"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="188">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</a><br/>
<a NAME="189">The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="190">And all the rest look like a chidden train:</a><br/>
<a NAME="191">Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</a><br/>
<a NAME="192">Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</a><br/>
<a NAME="193">As we have seen him in the Capitol,</a><br/>
<a NAME="194">Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech44"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="195">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech45"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="196">Antonius!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech46"><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="197">Caesar?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech47"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="198">Let me have men about me that are fat;</a><br/>
<a NAME="199">Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</a><br/>
<a NAME="200">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</a><br/>
<a NAME="201">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech48"><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="202">Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</a><br/>
<a NAME="203">He is a noble Roman and well given.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech49"><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="204">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</a><br/>
<a NAME="205">Yet if my name were liable to fear,</a><br/>
<a NAME="206">I do not know the man I should avoid</a><br/>
<a NAME="207">So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</a><br/>
<a NAME="208">He is a great observer and he looks</a><br/>
<a NAME="209">Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</a><br/>
<a NAME="210">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</a><br/>
<a NAME="211">Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</a><br/>
<a NAME="212">As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</a><br/>
<a NAME="213">That could be moved to smile at any thing.</a><br/>
<a NAME="214">Such men as he be never at heart's ease</a><br/>
<a NAME="215">Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</a><br/>
<a NAME="216">And therefore are they very dangerous.</a><br/>
<a NAME="217">I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="218">Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</a><br/>
<a NAME="219">Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</a><br/>
<a NAME="220">And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</a><br/>
<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</i></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech51"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="222">Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</a><br/>
<a NAME="223">That Caesar looks so sad.</a><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a NAME="224">Why, you were with him, were you not?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech53"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="225">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech54"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="226">Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</a><br/>
<a NAME="227">offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</a><br/>
<a NAME="228">thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech55"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="229">What was the second noise for?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech56"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="230">Why, for that too.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech57"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech59"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>

<blockquote>
<a NAME="234">Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</a><br/>
<a NAME="235">time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</a><br/>
<a NAME="236">mine honest neighbours shouted.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech61"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="237">Who offered him the crown?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech62"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="238">Why, Antony.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech63"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="239">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech64"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="240">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</a><br/>
<a NAME="241">it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</a><br/>
<a NAME="242">Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</a><br/>
<a NAME="243">neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</a><br/>
<a NAME="244">you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</a><br/>
<a NAME="245">thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</a><br/>
<a NAME="246">offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</a><br/>
<a NAME="247">but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</a><br/>
<a NAME="248">fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</a><br/>
<a NAME="249">time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</a><br/>
<a NAME="250">refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</a><br/>
<a NAME="251">chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</a><br/>
<a NAME="252">and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</a><br/>
<a NAME="253">Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</a><br/>
<a NAME="254">Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</a><br/>
<a NAME="255">for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</a><br/>
<a NAME="256">opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech65"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="257">But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech66"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="258">He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</a><br/>
<a NAME="259">mouth, and was speechless.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech67"><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="260">'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech68"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="261">No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</a><br/>
<a NAME="262">And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech69"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="263">I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</a><br/>
<a NAME="264">Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</a><br/>
<a NAME="265">clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</a><br/>
<a NAME="266">displeased them, as they use to do the players in</a><br/>
<a NAME="267">the theatre, I am no true man.</a><br/>

<a NAME="speech71"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="269">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</a><br/>
<a NAME="270">common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</a><br/>
<a NAME="271">plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</a><br/>
<a NAME="272">throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</a><br/>
<a NAME="273">occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</a><br/>
<a NAME="274">I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</a><br/>
<a NAME="275">he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</a><br/>
<a NAME="276">If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</a><br/>
<a NAME="277">their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</a><br/>
<a NAME="278">or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</a><br/>
<a NAME="279">soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</a><br/>
<a NAME="280">there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</a><br/>
<a NAME="281">stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</a><br/>

<a NAME="282">And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</a><br/>

<a NAME="283">Ay.</a><br/>

<a NAME="speech74"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>

<a NAME="284">Did Cicero say any thing?</a><br/>

<a NAME="285">Ay, he spoke Greek.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech76"><b>CASSIUS</b></a>

<a NAME="286">To what effect?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech77"><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="287">Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</a><br/>
<a NAME="288">face again: but those that understood him smiled at</a><br/>
<a NAME="289">one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</a><br/>
<a NAME="290">part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</a><br/>
<a NAME="291">news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</a><br/>
<a NAME="292">off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</a><br/>
<a NAME="293">well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</a><br/>
<a NAME="294">remember it.</a><br/>

<a NAME="304">So is he now in execution</a><br/>
<a NAME="305">Of any bold or noble enterprise,</a><br/>
<a NAME="306">However he puts on this tardy form.</a><br/>
<a NAME="307">This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</a><br/>

<a NAME="315">Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</a><br/>
<a NAME="316">Thy honourable metal may be wrought</a><br/>
<a NAME="317">From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</a><br/>
<a NAME="318">That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</a><br/>
<a NAME="319">For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</a><br/>
<a NAME="320">Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</a><br/>
<a NAME="321">If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</a><br/>
<a NAME="322">He should not humour me. I will this night,</a><br/>
<a NAME="323">In several hands, in at his windows throw,</a><br/>
<a NAME="324">As if they came from several citizens,</a><br/>
<a NAME="325">Writings all tending to the great opinion</a><br/>
<a NAME="326">That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</a><br/>
<a NAME="327">Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</a><br/>
<a NAME="328">And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</a><br/>
