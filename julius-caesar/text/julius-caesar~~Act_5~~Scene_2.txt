_S_SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.
_D_Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA
_R_BRUTUS
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.
_D_Loud alarum
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
_D_Exeunt
