_S_SCENE III. A street.
_D_Enter CINNA the poet
_R_CINNA THE POET
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
_D_Enter Citizens
_R_First Citizen
What is your name?
_R_Second Citizen
Whither are you going?
_R_Third Citizen
Where do you dwell?
_R_Fourth Citizen
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
_R_Second Citizen
Answer every man directly.
_R_First Citizen
Ay, and briefly.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Ay, and wisely.
_R_Third Citizen
Ay, and truly, you were best.
_R_CINNA THE POET
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
_R_Second Citizen
That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
_R_CINNA THE POET
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
_R_First Citizen
As a friend or an enemy?
_R_CINNA THE POET
As a friend.
_R_Second Citizen
That matter is answered directly.
_R_Fourth Citizen
For your dwelling,--briefly.
_R_CINNA THE POET
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
_R_Third Citizen
Your name, sir, truly.
_R_CINNA THE POET
Truly, my name is Cinna.
_R_First Citizen
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
_R_CINNA THE POET
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
_R_CINNA THE POET
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
_R_Fourth Citizen
It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
name out of his heart, and turn him going.
_R_Third Citizen
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
_D_Exeunt
