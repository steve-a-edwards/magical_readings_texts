_S_SCENE II. The Forum.
_D_Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens
_R_Citizens
We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
_R_BRUTUS
Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street,
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.
_R_First Citizen
I will hear Brutus speak.
_R_Second Citizen
I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
When severally we hear them rendered.
_D_Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit
_R_Third Citizen
The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
_R_BRUTUS
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
_R_All
None, Brutus, none.
_R_BRUTUS
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.
_D_Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.
_R_All
Live, Brutus! live, live!
_R_First Citizen
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
_R_Second Citizen
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
_R_Third Citizen
Let him be Caesar.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Caesar's better parts
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
_R_First Citizen
We'll bring him to his house
With shouts and clamours.
_R_BRUTUS
My countrymen,--
_R_Second Citizen
Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
_R_First Citizen
Peace, ho!
_R_BRUTUS
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
_D_Exit
_R_First Citizen
Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
_R_Third Citizen
Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
_R_ANTONY
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
_D_Goes into the pulpit
_R_Fourth Citizen
What does he say of Brutus?
_R_Third Citizen
He says, for Brutus' sake,
He finds himself beholding to us all.
_R_Fourth Citizen
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
_R_First Citizen
This Caesar was a tyrant.
_R_Third Citizen
Nay, that's certain:
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
_R_Second Citizen
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
_R_ANTONY
You gentle Romans,--
_R_Citizens
Peace, ho! let us hear him.
_R_ANTONY
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
_R_First Citizen
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
_R_Second Citizen
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.
_R_Third Citizen
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
_R_First Citizen
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
_R_Second Citizen
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
_R_Third Citizen
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
_R_ANTONY
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.
_R_Fourth Citizen
We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
_R_All
The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
_R_ANTONY
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
_R_Fourth Citizen
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
_R_ANTONY
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
_R_Fourth Citizen
They were traitors: honourable men!
_R_All
The will! the testament!
_R_Second Citizen
They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
_R_ANTONY
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
_R_Several Citizens
Come down.
_R_Second Citizen
Descend.
_R_Third Citizen
You shall have leave.
_D_ANTONY comes down
_R_Fourth Citizen
A ring; stand round.
_R_First Citizen
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
_R_Second Citizen
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
_R_ANTONY
Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
_R_Several Citizens
Stand back; room; bear back.
_R_ANTONY
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
_R_First Citizen
O piteous spectacle!
_R_Second Citizen
O noble Caesar!
_R_Third Citizen
O woful day!
_R_Fourth Citizen
O traitors, villains!
_R_First Citizen
O most bloody sight!
_R_Second Citizen
We will be revenged.
_R_All
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
_R_ANTONY
Stay, countrymen.
_R_First Citizen
Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
_R_Second Citizen
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
_R_ANTONY
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
_R_All
We'll mutiny.
_R_First Citizen
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
_R_Third Citizen
Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
_R_ANTONY
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
_R_All
Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
_R_ANTONY
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
You have forgot the will I told you of.
_R_All
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
_R_ANTONY
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
_R_Second Citizen
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
_R_Third Citizen
O royal Caesar!
_R_ANTONY
Hear me with patience.
_R_All
Peace, ho!
_R_ANTONY
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
_R_First Citizen
Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
_R_Second Citizen
Go fetch fire.
_R_Third Citizen
Pluck down benches.
_R_Fourth Citizen
Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
_D_Exeunt Citizens with the body
_R_ANTONY
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt!
_D_Enter a Servant
How now, fellow!
_R_Servant
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
_R_ANTONY
Where is he?
_R_Servant
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
_R_ANTONY
And thither will I straight to visit him:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
And in this mood will give us any thing.
_R_Servant
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
_R_ANTONY
Belike they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
_D_Exeunt
