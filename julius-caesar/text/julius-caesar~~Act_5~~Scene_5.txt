_S_SCENE V. Another part of the field.
_D_Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS
_R_BRUTUS
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
_R_CLITUS
Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
_R_BRUTUS
Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
_D_Whispers
_R_CLITUS
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
_R_BRUTUS
Peace then! no words.
_R_CLITUS
I'll rather kill myself.
_R_BRUTUS
Hark thee, Dardanius.
_D_Whispers
_R_DARDANIUS
Shall I do such a deed?
_R_CLITUS
O Dardanius!
_R_DARDANIUS
O Clitus!
_R_CLITUS
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
_R_DARDANIUS
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
_R_CLITUS
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes.
_R_BRUTUS
Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
_R_VOLUMNIUS
What says my lord?
_R_BRUTUS
Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
I know my hour is come.
_R_VOLUMNIUS
Not so, my lord.
_R_BRUTUS
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
_D_Low alarums
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
_R_VOLUMNIUS
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
_D_Alarum still
_R_CLITUS
Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
_R_BRUTUS
Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
_D_Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'
_R_CLITUS
Fly, my lord, fly.
_R_BRUTUS
Hence! I will follow.
_D_Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
_R_STRATO
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
_R_BRUTUS
Farewell, good Strato.
_D_Runs on his sword
Caesar, now be still:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
_D_Dies
_D_Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army
_R_OCTAVIUS
What man is that?
_R_MESSALA
My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
_R_STRATO
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honour by his death.
_R_LUCILIUS
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
_R_OCTAVIUS
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
_R_STRATO
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
_R_OCTAVIUS
Do so, good Messala.
_R_MESSALA
How died my master, Strato?
_R_STRATO
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
_R_MESSALA
Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
That did the latest service to my master.
_R_ANTONY
This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
_R_OCTAVIUS
According to his virtue let us use him,
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
So call the field to rest; and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.
_D_Exeunt
