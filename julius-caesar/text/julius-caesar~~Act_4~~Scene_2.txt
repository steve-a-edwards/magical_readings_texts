_S_SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.
_D_Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them
_R_BRUTUS
Stand, ho!
_R_LUCILIUS
Give the word, ho! and stand.
_R_BRUTUS
What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
_R_LUCILIUS
He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.
_R_BRUTUS
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.
_R_PINDARUS
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
_R_BRUTUS
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
How he received you, let me be resolved.
_R_LUCILIUS
With courtesy and with respect enough;
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.
_R_BRUTUS
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay,
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
_R_LUCILIUS
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.
_R_BRUTUS
Hark! he is arrived.
_D_Low march within
March gently on to meet him.
_D_Enter CASSIUS and his powers
_R_CASSIUS
Stand, ho!
_R_BRUTUS
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
_R_First Soldier
Stand!
_R_Second Soldier
Stand!
_R_Third Soldier
Stand!
_R_CASSIUS
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
_R_BRUTUS
Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
_R_CASSIUS
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
And when you do them--
_R_BRUTUS
Cassius, be content.
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.
_R_CASSIUS
Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.
_R_BRUTUS
Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
_D_Exeunt
