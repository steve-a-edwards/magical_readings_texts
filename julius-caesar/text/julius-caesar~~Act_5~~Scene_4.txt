_S_SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
_D_Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others
_R_BRUTUS
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
_R_CATO
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
_R_BRUTUS
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
_D_Exit
_R_LUCILIUS
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
_R_First Soldier
Yield, or thou diest.
_R_LUCILIUS
Only I yield to die:
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
_D_Offering money
Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
_R_First Soldier
We must not. A noble prisoner!
_R_Second Soldier
Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
_R_First Soldier
I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
_D_Enter ANTONY
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
_R_ANTONY
Where is he?
_R_LUCILIUS
Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
_R_ANTONY
This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How every thing is chanced.
_D_Exeunt
