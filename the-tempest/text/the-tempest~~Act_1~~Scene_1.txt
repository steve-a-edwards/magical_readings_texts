_S_SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
_D_Enter a Master and a Boatswain
_R_Master
Boatswain!
_R_Boatswain
Here, master: what cheer?
_R_Master
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
_D_Exit
_D_Enter Mariners
_R_Boatswain
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!
_D_Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others
_R_ALONSO
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.
_R_Boatswain
I pray now, keep below.
_R_ANTONIO
Where is the master, boatswain?
_R_Boatswain
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.
_R_GONZALO
Nay, good, be patient.
_R_Boatswain
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
_R_GONZALO
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
_R_Boatswain
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.
_D_Exit
_R_GONZALO
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Re-enter Boatswain
_R_Boatswain
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
_D_A cry within
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
_D_Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
_R_SEBASTIAN
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!
_R_Boatswain
Work you then.
_R_ANTONIO
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
_R_GONZALO
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.
_R_Boatswain
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.
_D_Enter Mariners wet
_R_Mariners
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
_R_Boatswain
What, must our mouths be cold?
_R_GONZALO
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.
_R_SEBASTIAN
I'm out of patience.
_R_ANTONIO
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
_R_GONZALO
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.
_D_A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'
_R_ANTONIO
Let's all sink with the king.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Let's take leave of him.
_D_Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
_R_GONZALO
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.
_D_Exeunt
