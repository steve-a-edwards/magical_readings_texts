_S_SCENE I. Another part of the island.
_D_Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
_R_GONZALO
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
_R_ALONSO
Prithee, peace.
_R_SEBASTIAN
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
_R_ANTONIO
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.
_R_GONZALO
Sir,--
_R_SEBASTIAN
One: tell.
_R_GONZALO
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--
_R_SEBASTIAN
A dollar.
_R_GONZALO
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.
_R_SEBASTIAN
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
_R_GONZALO
Therefore, my lord,--
_R_ANTONIO
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
_R_ALONSO
I prithee, spare.
_R_GONZALO
Well, I have done: but yet,--
_R_SEBASTIAN
He will be talking.
_R_ANTONIO
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?
_R_SEBASTIAN
The old cock.
_R_ANTONIO
The cockerel.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Done. The wager?
_R_ANTONIO
A laughter.
_R_SEBASTIAN
A match!
_R_ADRIAN
Though this island seem to be desert,--
_R_SEBASTIAN
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
_R_ADRIAN
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
_R_SEBASTIAN
Yet,--
_R_ADRIAN
Yet,--
_R_ANTONIO
He could not miss't.
_R_ADRIAN
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.
_R_ANTONIO
Temperance was a delicate wench.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
_R_ADRIAN
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
_R_SEBASTIAN
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
_R_ANTONIO
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
_R_GONZALO
Here is everything advantageous to life.
_R_ANTONIO
True; save means to live.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Of that there's none, or little.
_R_GONZALO
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
_R_ANTONIO
The ground indeed is tawny.
_R_SEBASTIAN
With an eye of green in't.
_R_ANTONIO
He misses not much.
_R_SEBASTIAN
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
_R_GONZALO
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--
_R_SEBASTIAN
As many vouched rarities are.
_R_GONZALO
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.
_R_ANTONIO
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?
_R_SEBASTIAN
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
_R_GONZALO
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
_R_SEBASTIAN
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
_R_ADRIAN
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.
_R_GONZALO
Not since widow Dido's time.
_R_ANTONIO
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!
_R_SEBASTIAN
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!
_R_ADRIAN
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
_R_GONZALO
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
_R_ADRIAN
Carthage?
_R_GONZALO
I assure you, Carthage.
_R_SEBASTIAN
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.
_R_ANTONIO
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
_R_SEBASTIAN
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.
_R_ANTONIO
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.
_R_GONZALO
Ay.
_R_ANTONIO
Why, in good time.
_R_GONZALO
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.
_R_ANTONIO
And the rarest that e'er came there.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
_R_ANTONIO
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
_R_GONZALO
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.
_R_ANTONIO
That sort was well fished for.
_R_GONZALO
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
_R_ALONSO
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?
_R_FRANCISCO
Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.
_R_ALONSO
No, no, he's gone.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
_R_ALONSO
Prithee, peace.
_R_SEBASTIAN
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.
_R_ALONSO
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
_R_GONZALO
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Very well.
_R_ANTONIO
And most chirurgeonly.
_R_GONZALO
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Foul weather?
_R_ANTONIO
Very foul.
_R_GONZALO
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
_R_ANTONIO
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Or docks, or mallows.
_R_GONZALO
And were the king on't, what would I do?
_R_SEBASTIAN
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
_R_GONZALO
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--
_R_SEBASTIAN
Yet he would be king on't.
_R_ANTONIO
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.
_R_GONZALO
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
_R_SEBASTIAN
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
_R_ANTONIO
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
_R_GONZALO
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.
_R_SEBASTIAN
God save his majesty!
_R_ANTONIO
Long live Gonzalo!
_R_GONZALO
And,--do you mark me, sir?
_R_ALONSO
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
_R_GONZALO
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.
_R_ANTONIO
'Twas you we laughed at.
_R_GONZALO
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.
_R_ANTONIO
What a blow was there given!
_R_SEBASTIAN
An it had not fallen flat-long.
_R_GONZALO
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.
_D_Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music
_R_SEBASTIAN
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
_R_ANTONIO
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
_R_GONZALO
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?
_R_ANTONIO
Go sleep, and hear us.
_D_All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
_R_ALONSO
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.
_R_ANTONIO
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.
_R_ALONSO
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
_D_ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
_R_SEBASTIAN
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
_R_ANTONIO
It is the quality o' the climate.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.
_R_ANTONIO
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.
_R_SEBASTIAN
What, art thou waking?
_R_ANTONIO
Do you not hear me speak?
_R_SEBASTIAN
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.
_R_ANTONIO
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Thou dost snore distinctly;
There's meaning in thy snores.
_R_ANTONIO
I am more serious than my custom: you
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Well, I am standing water.
_R_ANTONIO
I'll teach you how to flow.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Do so: to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me.
_R_ANTONIO
O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Prithee, say on:
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield.
_R_ANTONIO
Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
And he that sleeps here swims.
_R_SEBASTIAN
I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.
_R_ANTONIO
O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?
_R_SEBASTIAN
He's gone.
_R_ANTONIO
Then, tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?
_R_SEBASTIAN
Claribel.
_R_ANTONIO
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.
_R_SEBASTIAN
What stuff is this! how say you?
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
There is some space.
_R_ANTONIO
A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?
_R_SEBASTIAN
Methinks I do.
_R_ANTONIO
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?
_R_SEBASTIAN
I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.
_R_ANTONIO
True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
_R_SEBASTIAN
But, for your conscience?
_R_ANTONIO
Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.
_R_SEBASTIAN
Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.
_R_ANTONIO
Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.
_R_SEBASTIAN
O, but one word.
_D_They talk apart
_D_Re-enter ARIEL, invisible
_R_ARIEL
My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
For else his project dies--to keep them living.
_D_Sings in GONZALO's ear
While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:
Awake, awake!
_R_ANTONIO
Then let us both be sudden.
_R_GONZALO
Now, good angels
Preserve the king.
_D_They wake
_R_ALONSO
Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
_R_GONZALO
What's the matter?
_R_SEBASTIAN
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
_R_ALONSO
I heard nothing.
_R_ANTONIO
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.
_R_ALONSO
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
_R_GONZALO
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
_R_ALONSO
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son.
_R_GONZALO
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' the island.
_R_ALONSO
Lead away.
_R_ARIEL
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
_D_Exeunt
