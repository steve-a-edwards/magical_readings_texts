<h3>SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter BENEDICK</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Boy!</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter Boy</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>Boy</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">Signior?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">to me in the orchard.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>Boy</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="5">I am here already, sir.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit Boy</i></p>
<a NAME="7">I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">another man is a fool when he dedicates his</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">such shallow follies in others, become the argument</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</a><br/>
<p><i>Withdraws</i></p>
<p><i>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">Come, shall we hear this music?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="37">Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="39">See you where Benedick hath hid himself?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="40">O, very well, my lord: the music ended,</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter BALTHASAR with Music</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="42">Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="43">O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">To slander music any more than once.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="45">It is the witness still of excellency</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">To put a strange face on his own perfection.</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="48">Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">Since many a wooer doth commence his suit</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">Yet will he swear he loves.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="52">Now, pray thee, come;</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">Do it in notes.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="55">                  Note this before my notes;</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="57">Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.</a><br/>
<p><i>Air</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="59">Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">all's done.</a><br/>
<p><i>The Song</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="63">     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Men were deceivers ever,</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">One foot in sea and one on shore,</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">To one thing constant never:</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">Then sigh not so, but let them go,</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">And be you blithe and bonny,</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">Converting all your sounds of woe</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">Into Hey nonny, nonny.</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">Of dumps so dull and heavy;</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">The fraud of men was ever so,</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">Since summer first was leafy:</a><br/>
<a NAME="75-1">Then sigh not so, but let them go</a><br/>
<a NAME="75-2">And be you blithe and bonny,</a><br/>
<a NAME="75-3">Converting all your sounds of woe</a><br/>
<a NAME="75-4">Into Hey, nonny nonny.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="76">By my troth, a good song.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="77">And an ill singer, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="78">Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="79">An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">night-raven, come what plague could have come after</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="87">The best I can, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="88">Do so: farewell.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit BALTHASAR</i></p>
<a NAME="89">Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">Signior Benedick?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="92">O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did</a><br/>
<a NAME="93">never think that lady would have loved any man.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="94">No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in</a><br/>
<a NAME="96">all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="97">Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="98">By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think</a><br/>
<a NAME="99">of it but that she loves him with an enraged</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="101">May be she doth but counterfeit.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="102">Faith, like enough.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="103">O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">passion came so near the life of passion as she</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">discovers it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="106">Why, what effects of passion shows she?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="107">Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech35"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="108">What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">my daughter tell you how.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="110">She did, indeed.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech37"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="111">How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">thought her spirit had been invincible against all</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">assaults of affection.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech38"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="114">I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">against Benedick.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech39"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="116">I should think this a gull, but that the</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,</a><br/>
<a NAME="118">sure, hide himself in such reverence.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech40"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="119">He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech41"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="120">Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech42"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="121">No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech43"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="122">'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him</a><br/>
<a NAME="124">with scorn, write to him that I love him?'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech44"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="125">This says she now when she is beginning to write to</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and</a><br/>
<a NAME="127">there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech45"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="129">Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">pretty jest your daughter told us of.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech46"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="131">O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</a><br/>
<a NAME="132">found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech47"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="133">That.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech48"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="134">O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</a><br/>
<a NAME="136">to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I</a><br/>
<a NAME="137">measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I</a><br/>
<a NAME="138">should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</a><br/>
<a NAME="139">love him, I should.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech49"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="140">Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</a><br/>
<a NAME="141">beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O</a><br/>
<a NAME="142">sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech50"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="143">She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</a><br/>
<a NAME="144">ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</a><br/>
<a NAME="145">is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</a><br/>
<a NAME="146">to herself: it is very true.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech51"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="147">It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</a><br/>
<a NAME="148">other, if she will not discover it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech52"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="149">To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</a><br/>
<a NAME="150">torment the poor lady worse.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech53"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="151">An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an</a><br/>
<a NAME="152">excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,</a><br/>
<a NAME="153">she is virtuous.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech54"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="154">And she is exceeding wise.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech55"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="155">In every thing but in loving Benedick.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech56"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="156">O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</a><br/>
<a NAME="157">a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</a><br/>
<a NAME="158">the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</a><br/>
<a NAME="159">cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech57"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="160">I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</a><br/>
<a NAME="161">have daffed all other respects and made her half</a><br/>
<a NAME="162">myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</a><br/>
<a NAME="163">what a' will say.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech58"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="164">Were it good, think you?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech59"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="165">Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</a><br/>
<a NAME="166">will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</a><br/>
<a NAME="167">she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</a><br/>
<a NAME="168">her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</a><br/>
<a NAME="169">accustomed crossness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech60"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="170">She doth well: if she should make tender of her</a><br/>
<a NAME="171">love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the</a><br/>
<a NAME="172">man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech61"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="173">He is a very proper man.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech62"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="174">He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech63"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="175">Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech64"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="176">He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech65"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="177">And I take him to be valiant.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech66"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="178">As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</a><br/>
<a NAME="179">quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</a><br/>
<a NAME="180">avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</a><br/>
<a NAME="181">them with a most Christian-like fear.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech67"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="182">If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:</a><br/>
<a NAME="183">if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</a><br/>
<a NAME="184">quarrel with fear and trembling.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech68"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="185">And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</a><br/>
<a NAME="186">howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</a><br/>
<a NAME="187">he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</a><br/>
<a NAME="188">we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech69"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="189">Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</a><br/>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech70"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="191">Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech71"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="192">Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</a><br/>
<a NAME="193">let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</a><br/>
<a NAME="194">could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</a><br/>
<a NAME="195">how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech72"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="196">My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech73"><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>

<a NAME="speech74"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="199">Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</a><br/>

<a NAME="202">another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the</a><br/>
<a NAME="203">scene that I would see, which will be merely a</a><br/>

<a NAME="205">[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the</a><br/>
<a NAME="206">conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</a><br/>
<a NAME="207">this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</a><br/>
<a NAME="208">seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</a><br/>
<a NAME="209">why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</a><br/>
<a NAME="210">they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</a><br/>
<a NAME="211">the love come from her; they say too that she will</a><br/>
<a NAME="212">rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</a><br/>
<a NAME="213">never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</a><br/>
<a NAME="214">are they that hear their detractions and can put</a><br/>
<a NAME="215">them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a</a><br/>
<a NAME="216">truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis</a><br/>
<a NAME="217">so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</a><br/>
<a NAME="218">me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</a><br/>
<a NAME="219">no great argument of her folly, for I will be</a><br/>
<a NAME="220">horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</a><br/>
<a NAME="221">odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="222">because I have railed so long against marriage: but</a><br/>

<a NAME="243">no more pains for those thanks than you took pains</a><br/>
<a NAME="244">to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains</a><br/>
<a NAME="245">that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do</a><br/>
<a NAME="246">not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not</a><br/>
<a NAME="247">love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</a><br/>
