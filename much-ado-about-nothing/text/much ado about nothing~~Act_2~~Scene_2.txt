_S_SCENE II. The same.
_D_Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
_R_DON JOHN
It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
daughter of Leonato.
_R_BORACHIO
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
_R_DON JOHN
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
_R_BORACHIO
Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
dishonesty shall appear in me.
_R_DON JOHN
Show me briefly how.
_R_BORACHIO
I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
gentlewoman to Hero.
_R_DON JOHN
I remember.
_R_BORACHIO
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
_R_DON JOHN
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
_R_BORACHIO
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
_R_DON JOHN
What proof shall I make of that?
_R_BORACHIO
Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
other issue?
_R_DON JOHN
Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
_R_BORACHIO
Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
offer them instances; which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
_R_DON JOHN
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
thy fee is a thousand ducats.
_R_BORACHIO
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
shall not shame me.
_R_DON JOHN
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
_D_Exeunt
