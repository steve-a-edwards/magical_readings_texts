_S_SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.
_D_Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
_R_HERO
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
her to rise.
_R_URSULA
I will, lady.
_R_HERO
And bid her come hither.
_R_URSULA
Well.
_D_Exit
_R_MARGARET
Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
_R_HERO
No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
_R_MARGARET
By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
cousin will say so.
_R_HERO
My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
none but this.
_R_MARGARET
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
gown that they praise so.
_R_HERO
O, that exceeds, they say.
_R_MARGARET
By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
_R_HERO
God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
exceeding heavy.
_R_MARGARET
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
_R_HERO
Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
_R_MARGARET
Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
honourable without marriage? I think you would have
me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.
_D_Enter BEATRICE
_R_HERO
Good morrow, coz.
_R_BEATRICE
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
_R_HERO
Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
_R_BEATRICE
I am out of all other tune, methinks.
_R_MARGARET
Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
_R_BEATRICE
Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
lack no barns.
_R_MARGARET
O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
_R_BEATRICE
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
_R_MARGARET
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
_R_BEATRICE
For the letter that begins them all, H.
_R_MARGARET
Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
sailing by the star.
_R_BEATRICE
What means the fool, trow?
_R_MARGARET
Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
_R_HERO
These gloves the count sent me; they are an
excellent perfume.
_R_BEATRICE
I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.
_R_MARGARET
A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
_R_BEATRICE
O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
professed apprehension?
_R_MARGARET
Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
_R_BEATRICE
It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
cap. By my troth, I am sick.
_R_MARGARET
Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
_R_HERO
There thou prickest her with a thistle.
_R_BEATRICE
Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
this Benedictus.
_R_MARGARET
Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
are in love or that you will be in love or that you
can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
now is he become a man: he swore he would never
marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
his meat without grudging: and how you may be
converted I know not, but methinks you look with
your eyes as other women do.
_R_BEATRICE
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
_R_MARGARET
Not a false gallop.
_D_Re-enter URSULA
_R_URSULA
Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
town, are come to fetch you to church.
_R_HERO
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
_D_Exeunt
