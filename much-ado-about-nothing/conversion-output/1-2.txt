_S_SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.
_D_Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting
_R_LEONATO
How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
hath he provided this music?
_R_ANTONIO
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
_R_LEONATO
Are they good?
_R_ANTONIO
As the event stamps them: but they have a good
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance: and if he found her
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
top and instantly break with you of it.
_R_LEONATO
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
_R_ANTONIO
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
question him yourself.
_R_LEONATO
No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
_D_Enter Attendants
Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
_D_Exeunt
