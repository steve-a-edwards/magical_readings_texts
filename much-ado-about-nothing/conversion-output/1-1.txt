_S_SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
_D_Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger
_R_LEONATO
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
comes this night to Messina.
_R_Messenger
He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
when I left him.
_R_LEONATO
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
_R_Messenger
But few of any sort, and none of name.
_R_LEONATO
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
_R_Messenger
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how.
_R_LEONATO
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
glad of it.
_R_Messenger
I have already delivered him letters, and there
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
bitterness.
_R_LEONATO
Did he break out into tears?
_R_Messenger
In great measure.
_R_LEONATO
A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
truer than those that are so washed. How much
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
_R_BEATRICE
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
wars or no?
_R_Messenger
I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
in the army of any sort.
_R_LEONATO
What is he that you ask for, niece?
_R_HERO
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
_R_Messenger
O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
_R_BEATRICE
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
_R_LEONATO
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
_R_Messenger
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
_R_BEATRICE
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
excellent stomach.
_R_Messenger
And a good soldier too, lady.
_R_BEATRICE
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
_R_Messenger
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
honourable virtues.
_R_BEATRICE
It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
_R_LEONATO
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
between them.
_R_BEATRICE
Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
_R_Messenger
Is't possible?
_R_BEATRICE
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
next block.
_R_Messenger
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
_R_BEATRICE
No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
you, who is his companion? Is there no young
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
_R_Messenger
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
_R_BEATRICE
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
thousand pound ere a' be cured.
_R_Messenger
I will hold friends with you, lady.
_R_BEATRICE
Do, good friend.
_R_LEONATO
You will never run mad, niece.
_R_BEATRICE
No, not till a hot January.
_R_Messenger
Don Pedro is approached.
_D_Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR
_R_DON PEDRO
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost, and you encounter it.
_R_LEONATO
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave.
_R_DON PEDRO
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
is your daughter.
_R_LEONATO
Her mother hath many times told me so.
_R_BENEDICK
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
_R_LEONATO
Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
_R_DON PEDRO
You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
honourable father.
_R_BENEDICK
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
like him as she is.
_R_BEATRICE
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
Benedick: nobody marks you.
_R_BENEDICK
What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
_R_BEATRICE
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
in her presence.
_R_BENEDICK
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart; for, truly, I love none.
_R_BEATRICE
A dear happiness to women: they would else have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me.
_R_BENEDICK
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
scratched face.
_R_BEATRICE
Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
a face as yours were.
_R_BENEDICK
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
_R_BEATRICE
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
_R_BENEDICK
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
name; I have done.
_R_BEATRICE
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
_R_DON PEDRO
That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month; and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
_R_LEONATO
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
_D_To DON JOHN
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
_R_DON JOHN
I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
you.
_R_LEONATO
Please it your grace lead on?
_R_DON PEDRO
Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
_D_Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
_R_CLAUDIO
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
_R_BENEDICK
I noted her not; but I looked on her.
_R_CLAUDIO
Is she not a modest young lady?
_R_BENEDICK
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
_R_CLAUDIO
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
_R_BENEDICK
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
afford her, that were she other than she is, she
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
do not like her.
_R_CLAUDIO
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her.
_R_BENEDICK
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
_R_CLAUDIO
Can the world buy such a jewel?
_R_BENEDICK
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
you, to go in the song?
_R_CLAUDIO
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
looked on.
_R_BENEDICK
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
_R_CLAUDIO
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
_R_BENEDICK
Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
_D_Re-enter DON PEDRO
_R_DON PEDRO
What secret hath held you here, that you followed
not to Leonato's?
_R_BENEDICK
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
_R_DON PEDRO
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
_R_BENEDICK
You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
man; I would have you think so; but, on my
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
short daughter.
_R_CLAUDIO
If this were so, so were it uttered.
_R_BENEDICK
Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
so.'
_R_CLAUDIO
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
should be otherwise.
_R_DON PEDRO
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
_R_CLAUDIO
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
_R_DON PEDRO
By my troth, I speak my thought.
_R_CLAUDIO
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
_R_BENEDICK
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
_R_CLAUDIO
That I love her, I feel.
_R_DON PEDRO
That she is worthy, I know.
_R_BENEDICK
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
_R_DON PEDRO
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
of beauty.
_R_CLAUDIO
And never could maintain his part but in the force
of his will.
_R_BENEDICK
That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
_R_DON PEDRO
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
_R_BENEDICK
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
blind Cupid.
_R_DON PEDRO
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
wilt prove a notable argument.
_R_BENEDICK
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
the shoulder, and called Adam.
_R_DON PEDRO
Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke.'
_R_BENEDICK
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
_R_CLAUDIO
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
_R_DON PEDRO
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
_R_BENEDICK
I look for an earthquake too, then.
_R_DON PEDRO
Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.
_R_BENEDICK
I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage; and so I commit you--
_R_CLAUDIO
To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
_R_DON PEDRO
The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
_R_BENEDICK
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
you flout old ends any further, examine your
conscience: and so I leave you.
_D_Exit
_R_CLAUDIO
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
_R_DON PEDRO
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
_R_CLAUDIO
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
_R_DON PEDRO
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
_R_CLAUDIO
O, my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
_R_DON PEDRO
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
_R_CLAUDIO
How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
_R_DON PEDRO
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practise let us put it presently.
