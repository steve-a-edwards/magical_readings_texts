_S_SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.
_D_Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
_R_LEONATO
Was not Count John here at supper?
_R_ANTONIO
I saw him not.
_R_BEATRICE
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
_R_HERO
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
_R_BEATRICE
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
like an image and says nothing, and the other too
like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
_R_LEONATO
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
Benedick's face,--
_R_BEATRICE
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
_R_LEONATO
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
_R_ANTONIO
In faith, she's too curst.
_R_BEATRICE
Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
_R_LEONATO
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
_R_BEATRICE
Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
_R_LEONATO
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
_R_BEATRICE
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
apes into hell.
_R_LEONATO
Well, then, go you into hell?
_R_BEATRICE
No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
there live we as merry as the day is long.
_R_ANTONIO
_D_To HERO
Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
by your father.
_R_BEATRICE
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
me.'
_R_LEONATO
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
_R_BEATRICE
Not till God make men of some other metal than
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
_R_LEONATO
Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
_R_BEATRICE
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
important, tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
_R_LEONATO
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
_R_BEATRICE
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
_R_LEONATO
The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
_D_All put on their masks
_D_Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked
_R_DON PEDRO
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
_R_HERO
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
_R_DON PEDRO
With me in your company?
_R_HERO
I may say so, when I please.
_R_DON PEDRO
And when please you to say so?
_R_HERO
When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
should be like the case!
_R_DON PEDRO
My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
_R_HERO
Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
_R_DON PEDRO
Speak low, if you speak love.
_D_Drawing her aside
_R_BALTHASAR
Well, I would you did like me.
_R_MARGARET
So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
ill-qualities.
_R_BALTHASAR
Which is one?
_R_MARGARET
I say my prayers aloud.
_R_BALTHASAR
I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
_R_MARGARET
God match me with a good dancer!
_R_BALTHASAR
Amen.
_R_MARGARET
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
done! Answer, clerk.
_R_BALTHASAR
No more words: the clerk is answered.
_R_URSULA
I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.
_R_ANTONIO
At a word, I am not.
_R_URSULA
I know you by the waggling of your head.
_R_ANTONIO
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
_R_URSULA
You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
are he, you are he.
_R_ANTONIO
At a word, I am not.
_R_URSULA
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
end.
_R_BEATRICE
Will you not tell me who told you so?
_R_BENEDICK
No, you shall pardon me.
_R_BEATRICE
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
_R_BENEDICK
Not now.
_R_BEATRICE
That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
Signior Benedick that said so.
_R_BENEDICK
What's he?
_R_BEATRICE
I am sure you know him well enough.
_R_BENEDICK
Not I, believe me.
_R_BEATRICE
Did he never make you laugh?
_R_BENEDICK
I pray you, what is he?
_R_BEATRICE
Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
none but libertines delight in him; and the
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
_R_BENEDICK
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
_R_BEATRICE
Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
supper that night.
_D_Music
We must follow the leaders.
_R_BENEDICK
In every good thing.
_R_BEATRICE
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
the next turning.
_D_Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO
_R_DON JOHN
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
_R_BORACHIO
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
_R_DON JOHN
Are not you Signior Benedick?
_R_CLAUDIO
You know me well; I am he.
_R_DON JOHN
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
do the part of an honest man in it.
_R_CLAUDIO
How know you he loves her?
_R_DON JOHN
I heard him swear his affection.
_R_BORACHIO
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
_R_DON JOHN
Come, let us to the banquet.
_D_Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO
_R_CLAUDIO
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
_D_Re-enter BENEDICK
_R_BENEDICK
Count Claudio?
_R_CLAUDIO
Yea, the same.
_R_BENEDICK
Come, will you go with me?
_R_CLAUDIO
Whither?
_R_BENEDICK
Even to the next willow, about your own business,
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
_R_CLAUDIO
I wish him joy of her.
_R_BENEDICK
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
have served you thus?
_R_CLAUDIO
I pray you, leave me.
_R_BENEDICK
Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
_R_CLAUDIO
If it will not be, I'll leave you.
_D_Exit
_R_BENEDICK
Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
_D_Re-enter DON PEDRO
_R_DON PEDRO
Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
_R_BENEDICK
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
_R_DON PEDRO
To be whipped! What's his fault?
_R_BENEDICK
The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
companion, and he steals it.
_R_DON PEDRO
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.
_R_BENEDICK
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
and the garland too; for the garland he might have
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
_R_DON PEDRO
I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
the owner.
_R_BENEDICK
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
you say honestly.
_R_DON PEDRO
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you.
_R_BENEDICK
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
and perturbation follows her.
_R_DON PEDRO
Look, here she comes.
_D_Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO
_R_BENEDICK
Will your grace command me any service to the
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
rather than hold three words' conference with this
harpy. You have no employment for me?
_R_DON PEDRO
None, but to desire your good company.
_R_BENEDICK
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
endure my Lady Tongue.
_D_Exit
_R_DON PEDRO
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
Signior Benedick.
_R_BEATRICE
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
_R_DON PEDRO
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
_R_BEATRICE
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
_R_DON PEDRO
Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
_R_CLAUDIO
Not sad, my lord.
_R_DON PEDRO
How then? sick?
_R_CLAUDIO
Neither, my lord.
_R_BEATRICE
The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
something of that jealous complexion.
_R_DON PEDRO
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained: name the day of
marriage, and God give thee joy!
_R_LEONATO
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
grace say Amen to it.
_R_BEATRICE
Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
_R_CLAUDIO
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange.
_R_BEATRICE
Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
_R_DON PEDRO
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
_R_BEATRICE
Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart.
_R_CLAUDIO
And so she doth, cousin.
_R_BEATRICE
Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
_R_DON PEDRO
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
_R_BEATRICE
I would rather have one of your father's getting.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
_R_DON PEDRO
Will you have me, lady?
_R_BEATRICE
No, my lord, unless I might have another for
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
_R_DON PEDRO
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
a merry hour.
_R_BEATRICE
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Cousins, God give you joy!
_R_LEONATO
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
_R_BEATRICE
I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
_D_Exit
_R_DON PEDRO
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
_R_LEONATO
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing.
_R_DON PEDRO
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
_R_LEONATO
O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
_R_DON PEDRO
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
_R_LEONATO
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
they would talk themselves mad.
_R_DON PEDRO
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
_R_CLAUDIO
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
have all his rites.
_R_LEONATO
Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
things answer my mind.
_R_DON PEDRO
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other. I would fain have
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction.
_R_LEONATO
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
nights' watchings.
_R_CLAUDIO
And I, my lord.
_R_DON PEDRO
And you too, gentle Hero?
_R_HERO
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
cousin to a good husband.
_R_DON PEDRO
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
and I will tell you my drift.
