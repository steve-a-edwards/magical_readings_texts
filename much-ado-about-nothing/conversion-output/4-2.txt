_S_CENE II. A prison.
_D_Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
_R_DOGBERRY
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
_R_VERGES
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
_R_Sexton
Which be the malefactors?
_R_DOGBERRY
Marry, that am I and my partner.
_R_VERGES
Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
_R_Sexton
But which are the offenders that are to be
examined? let them come before master constable.
_R_DOGBERRY
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
name, friend?
_R_BORACHIO
Borachio.
_R_DOGBERRY
Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
_R_CONRADE
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
_R_DOGBERRY
Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
you serve God?
_R_CONRADE BORACHIO
Yea, sir, we hope.
_R_DOGBERRY
Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
write God first; for God defend but God should go
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves; and it
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
you for yourselves?
_R_CONRADE
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
_R_DOGBERRY
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
you are false knaves.
_R_BORACHIO
Sir, I say to you we are none.
_R_DOGBERRY
Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
_R_Sexton
Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
_R_DOGBERRY
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
name, accuse these men.
_R_First Watchman
This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
brother, was a villain.
_R_DOGBERRY
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
_R_BORACHIO
Master constable,--
_R_DOGBERRY
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
I promise thee.
_R_Sexton
What heard you him say else?
_R_Second Watchman
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
_R_DOGBERRY
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
_R_VERGES
Yea, by mass, that it is.
_R_Sexton
What else, fellow?
_R_First Watchman
And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
_R_DOGBERRY
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
redemption for this.
_R_Sexton
What else?
_R_Watchman
This is all.
_R_Sexton
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
Master constable, let these men be bound, and
brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
him their examination.
_D_Exit
_R_DOGBERRY
Come, let them be opinioned.
_R_VERGES
Let them be in the hands--
_R_CONRADE
Off, coxcomb!
_R_DOGBERRY
God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
Thou naughty varlet!
_R_CONRADE
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
_R_DOGBERRY
Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
I had been writ down an ass!
