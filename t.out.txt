_S_SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
_D_Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
_R_GREGORY
_T_No, for then we should be colliers.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
_R_GREGORY
_T_Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_I strike quickly, being moved.
_R_GREGORY
_T_But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
_R_GREGORY
_T_To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
_T_therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
_T_take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
_R_GREGORY
_T_That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
_T_to the wall.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
_T_are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
_T_Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
_T_to the wall.
_R_GREGORY
_T_The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
_T_have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
_T_maids, and cut off their heads.
_R_GREGORY
_T_The heads of the maids?
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
_T_take it in what sense thou wilt.
_R_GREGORY
_T_They must take it in sense that feel it.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
_T_'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
_R_GREGORY
_T_'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
_T_hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
_T_two of the house of the Montagues.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
_R_GREGORY
_T_How! turn thy back and run?
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Fear me not.
_R_GREGORY
_T_No, marry; I fear thee!
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
_R_GREGORY
_T_I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
_T_they list.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
_T_which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
_D_Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
_R_ABRAHAM
_T_Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
_R_SAMPSON
_T_I do bite my thumb, sir.
_R_ABRAHAM
_T_Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
_R_SAMPSON
_T_[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
_T_ay?
_R_GREGORY
_T_No.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
_T_bite my thumb, sir.
_R_GREGORY
_T_Do you quarrel, sir?
_R_ABRAHAM
_T_Quarrel sir! no, sir.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
_R_ABRAHAM
_T_No better.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Well, sir.
_R_GREGORY
_T_Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Yes, better, sir.
_R_ABRAHAM
_T_You lie.
_R_SAMPSON
_T_Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
_D_They fight
_D_Enter BENVOLIO
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Part, fools!
_T_Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
_D_Beats down their swords
_D_Enter TYBALT
_R_TYBALT
_T_What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
_T_Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
_T_Or manage it to part these men with me.
_R_TYBALT
_T_What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
_T_As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
_T_Have at thee, coward!
_D_They fight
_D_Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
_R_First Citizen
_T_Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
_T_Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
_D_Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
_R_CAPULET
_T_What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
_R_LADY CAPULET
_T_A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
_R_CAPULET
_T_My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
_T_And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
_D_Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
_R_LADY MONTAGUE
_T_Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
_D_Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
_R_PRINCE
_T_Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
_T_Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
_T_Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
_T_That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
_T_With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
_T_On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
_T_Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
_T_And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
_T_Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
_T_By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
_T_Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
_T_And made Verona's ancient citizens
_T_Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
_T_To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
_T_Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
_T_If ever you disturb our streets again,
_T_Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
_T_For this time, all the rest depart away:
_T_You Capulet; shall go along with me:
_T_And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
_T_To know our further pleasure in this case,
_T_To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
_T_Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
_D_Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
_T_Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Here were the servants of your adversary,
_T_And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
_T_I drew to part them: in the instant came
_T_The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
_T_Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
_T_He swung about his head and cut the winds,
_T_Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
_T_While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
_T_Came more and more and fought on part and part,
_T_Till the prince came, who parted either part.
_R_LADY MONTAGUE
_T_O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
_T_Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
_T_Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
_T_A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
_T_Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
_T_That westward rooteth from the city's side,
_T_So early walking did I see your son:
_T_Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
_T_And stole into the covert of the wood:
_T_I, measuring his affections by my own,
_T_That most are busied when they're most alone,
_T_Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
_T_And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_Many a morning hath he there been seen,
_T_With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
_T_Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
_T_But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
_T_Should in the furthest east begin to draw
_T_The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
_T_Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
_T_And private in his chamber pens himself,
_T_Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
_T_And makes himself an artificial night:
_T_Black and portentous must this humour prove,
_T_Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_I neither know it nor can learn of him.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Have you importuned him by any means?
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_Both by myself and many other friends:
_T_But he, his own affections' counsellor,
_T_Is to himself--I will not say how true--
_T_But to himself so secret and so close,
_T_So far from sounding and discovery,
_T_As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
_T_Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
_T_Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
_T_Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
_T_We would as willingly give cure as know.
_D_Enter ROMEO
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
_T_I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
_R_MONTAGUE
_T_I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
_T_To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
_D_Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Good-morrow, cousin.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Is the day so young?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_But new struck nine.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Ay me! sad hours seem long.
_T_Was that my father that went hence so fast?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
_R_ROMEO
_T_Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_In love?
_R_ROMEO
_T_Out--
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Of love?
_R_ROMEO
_T_Out of her favour, where I am in love.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
_T_Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
_R_ROMEO
_T_Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
_T_Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
_T_Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
_T_Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
_T_Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
_T_Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
_T_O any thing, of nothing first create!
_T_O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
_T_Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
_T_Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
_T_sick health!
_T_Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
_T_This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
_T_Dost thou not laugh?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_No, coz, I rather weep.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Good heart, at what?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_At thy good heart's oppression.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Why, such is love's transgression.
_T_Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
_T_Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
_T_With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
_T_Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
_T_Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
_T_Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
_T_Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
_T_What is it else? a madness most discreet,
_T_A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
_T_Farewell, my coz.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Soft! I will go along;
_T_An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
_T_This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
_R_ROMEO
_T_What, shall I groan and tell thee?
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Groan! why, no.
_T_But sadly tell me who.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
_T_Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
_T_In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
_R_ROMEO
_T_A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
_R_ROMEO
_T_Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
_T_With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
_T_And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
_T_From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
_T_She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
_T_Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
_T_Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
_T_O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
_T_That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
_R_ROMEO
_T_She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
_T_For beauty starved with her severity
_T_Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
_T_She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
_T_To merit bliss by making me despair:
_T_She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
_T_Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
_R_ROMEO
_T_O, teach me how I should forget to think.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
_T_Examine other beauties.
_R_ROMEO
_T_'Tis the way
_T_To call hers exquisite, in question more:
_T_These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
_T_Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
_T_He that is strucken blind cannot forget
_T_The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
_T_Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
_T_What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
_T_Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
_T_Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
_R_BENVOLIO
_T_I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
_D_Exeunt
