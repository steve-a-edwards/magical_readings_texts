_S_SCENE I. A public place.
_D_Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
_R_BENVOLIO
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
_R_MERCUTIO
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
_R_BENVOLIO
Am I like such a fellow?
_R_MERCUTIO
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.
_R_BENVOLIO
And what to?
_R_MERCUTIO
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
_R_BENVOLIO
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
_R_MERCUTIO
The fee-simple! O simple!
_R_BENVOLIO
By my head, here come the Capulets.
_R_MERCUTIO
By my heel, I care not.
_D_Enter TYBALT and others
_R_TYBALT
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
_R_MERCUTIO
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.
_R_TYBALT
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion.
_R_MERCUTIO
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
_R_TYBALT
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
_R_MERCUTIO
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
_R_BENVOLIO
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
_R_MERCUTIO
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
_D_Enter ROMEO
_R_TYBALT
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
_R_MERCUTIO
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
_R_TYBALT
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
_R_ROMEO
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
_R_TYBALT
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
_R_ROMEO
I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
_R_MERCUTIO
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
_D_Draws
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
_R_TYBALT
What wouldst thou have with me?
_R_MERCUTIO
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.
_R_TYBALT
I am for you.
_D_Drawing
_R_ROMEO
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
_R_MERCUTIO
Come, sir, your passado.
_D_They fight
_R_ROMEO
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
_D_TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
_R_MERCUTIO
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
_R_BENVOLIO
What, art thou hurt?
_R_MERCUTIO
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
_D_Exit Page
_R_ROMEO
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
_R_MERCUTIO
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.
_R_ROMEO
I thought all for the best.
_R_MERCUTIO
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!
_D_Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
_R_ROMEO
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
_D_Re-enter BENVOLIO
_R_BENVOLIO
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
_R_ROMEO
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.
_R_BENVOLIO
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
_R_ROMEO
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
_D_Re-enter TYBALT
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
_R_TYBALT
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
_R_ROMEO
This shall determine that.
_D_They fight; TYBALT falls
_R_BENVOLIO
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
_R_ROMEO
O, I am fortune's fool!
_R_BENVOLIO
Why dost thou stay?
_D_Exit ROMEO
_D_Enter citizens of the watch
_R_First Citizen
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
_R_BENVOLIO
There lies that Tybalt.
_R_First Citizen
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
_D_Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
_R_PRINCE
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
_R_BENVOLIO
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
_R_LADY CAPULET
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!
_R_PRINCE
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
_R_BENVOLIO
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
_R_LADY CAPULET
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
_R_PRINCE
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
_R_MONTAGUE
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
_R_PRINCE
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
_D_Exeunt
