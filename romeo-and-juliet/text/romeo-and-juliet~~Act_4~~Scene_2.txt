_S_SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
_D_Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
_R_CAPULET
So many guests invite as here are writ.
_D_Exit First Servant
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
_R_Second Servant
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.
_R_CAPULET
How canst thou try them so?
_R_Second Servant
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.
_R_CAPULET
Go, be gone.
_D_Exit Second Servant
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
_R_Nurse
Ay, forsooth.
_R_CAPULET
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
_R_Nurse
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
_D_Enter JULIET
_R_CAPULET
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
_R_JULIET
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
_R_CAPULET
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
_R_JULIET
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
_R_CAPULET
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.
_R_JULIET
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
_R_LADY CAPULET
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
_R_CAPULET
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
_D_Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
_R_LADY CAPULET
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.
_R_CAPULET
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
_D_Exeunt
