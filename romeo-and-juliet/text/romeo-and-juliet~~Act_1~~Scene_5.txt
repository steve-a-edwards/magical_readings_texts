_S_SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
_D_Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
_R_First Servant
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
_R_Second Servant
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
_R_First Servant
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!
_R_Second Servant
Ay, boy, ready.
_R_First Servant
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.
_R_Second Servant
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
_D_Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
_R_CAPULET
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
_D_Music plays, and they dance
_R_Second Capulet
By'r lady, thirty years.
_R_CAPULET
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
_R_Second Capulet
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.
_R_CAPULET
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
_R_ROMEO
[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
_R_Servant
I know not, sir.
_R_ROMEO
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
_R_TYBALT
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
_R_CAPULET
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
_R_TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
_R_CAPULET
Young Romeo is it?
_R_TYBALT
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
_R_CAPULET
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
_R_TYBALT
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.
_R_CAPULET
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
_R_TYBALT
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
_R_CAPULET
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
_R_TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
_D_Exit
_R_ROMEO
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
_R_JULIET
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
_R_ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
_R_JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
_R_ROMEO
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
_R_JULIET
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
_R_ROMEO
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
_R_JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
_R_ROMEO
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.
_R_JULIET
You kiss by the book.
_R_Nurse
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
_R_ROMEO
What is her mother?
_R_Nurse
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
_R_ROMEO
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
_R_BENVOLIO
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
_R_ROMEO
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
_R_CAPULET
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.
_D_Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
_R_JULIET
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
_R_Nurse
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
_R_JULIET
What's he that now is going out of door?
_R_Nurse
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
_R_JULIET
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
_R_Nurse
I know not.
_R_JULIET
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
_R_Nurse
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.
_R_JULIET
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
_R_Nurse
What's this? what's this?
_R_JULIET
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
_D_One calls within 'Juliet.'
_R_Nurse
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
_D_Exeunt
