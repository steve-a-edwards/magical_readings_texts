<h3>SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>CAPULET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">That we have had no time to move our daughter:</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">I promise you, but for your company,</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">I would have been a-bed an hour ago.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>PARIS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">These times of woe afford no time to woo.</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>LADY CAPULET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="10">I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>CAPULET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">But, soft! what day is this?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>PARIS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="19">Monday, my lord,</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>CAPULET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="20">Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">She shall be married to this noble earl.</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">Will you be ready? do you like this haste?</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">It may be thought we held him carelessly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">Being our kinsman, if we revel much:</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>PARIS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="30">My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>CAPULET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Afore me! it is so very very late,</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">That we may call it early by and by.</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Good night.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
