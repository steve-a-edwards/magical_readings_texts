_S_SCENE VI. Near Misenum.
_D_Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching
_R_POMPEY
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
And we shall talk before we fight.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Most meet
That first we come to words; and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent;
Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.
_R_POMPEY
To you all three,
The senators alone of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
There saw you labouring for him. What was't
That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
To drench the Capitol; but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Take your time.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
How much we do o'er-count thee.
_R_POMPEY
At land, indeed,
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in't as thou mayst.
_R_LEPIDUS
Be pleased to tell us--
For this is from the present--how you take
The offers we have sent you.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
There's the point.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth embraced.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.
_R_POMPEY
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
Our targes undinted.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS
That's our offer.
_R_POMPEY
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepared
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience: though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.
_R_MARK ANTONY
I have heard it, Pompey;
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
_R_POMPEY
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
_R_MARK ANTONY
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gain'd by 't.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Since I saw you last,
There is a change upon you.
_R_POMPEY
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come,
To make my heart her vassal.
_R_LEPIDUS
Well met here.
_R_POMPEY
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
That's the next to do.
_R_POMPEY
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
_R_MARK ANTONY
That will I, Pompey.
_R_POMPEY
No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.
_R_MARK ANTONY
You have heard much.
_R_POMPEY
I have fair meanings, sir.
_R_MARK ANTONY
And fair words to them.
_R_POMPEY
Then so much have I heard:
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
No more of that: he did so.
_R_POMPEY
What, I pray you?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
_R_POMPEY
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Well;
And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
Four feasts are toward.
_R_POMPEY
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behavior.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Sir,
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did.
_R_POMPEY
Enjoy thy plainness,
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS
Show us the way, sir.
_R_POMPEY
Come.
_D_Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
_R_MENAS
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
At sea, I think.
_R_MENAS
We have, sir.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
You have done well by water.
_R_MENAS
And you by land.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.
_R_MENAS
Nor what I have done by water.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Yes, something you can deny for your own
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
_R_MENAS
And you by land.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
There I deny my land service. But give me your
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
might take two thieves kissing.
_R_MENAS
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
_R_MENAS
No slander; they steal hearts.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
We came hither to fight with you.
_R_MENAS
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
_R_MENAS
You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
_R_MENAS
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
_R_MENAS
Pray ye, sir?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
'Tis true.
_R_MENAS
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
not prophesy so.
_R_MENAS
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.
_R_MENAS
Who would not have his wife so?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.
_R_MENAS
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
I have a health for you.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
_R_MENAS
Come, let's away.
_D_Exeunt
