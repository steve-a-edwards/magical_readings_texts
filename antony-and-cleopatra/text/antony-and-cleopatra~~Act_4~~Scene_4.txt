_S_SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.
_D_Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending
_R_MARK ANTONY
Eros! mine armour, Eros!
_R_CLEOPATRA
Sleep a little.
_R_MARK ANTONY
No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
_D_Enter EROS with armour
Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her: come.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?
_R_MARK ANTONY
Ah, let be, let be! thou art
The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.
_R_EROS
Briefly, sir.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Is not this buckled well?
_R_MARK ANTONY
Rarely, rarely:
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
A workman in't.
_D_Enter an armed Soldier
Good morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.
_R_Soldier
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.
_D_Shout. Trumpets flourish
_D_Enter Captains and Soldiers
_R_Captain
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.
_R_All
Good morrow, general.
_R_MARK ANTONY
'Tis well blown, lads:
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
_D_Kisses her
And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
_D_Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers
_R_CHARMIAN
Please you, retire to your chamber.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
_D_Exeunt
