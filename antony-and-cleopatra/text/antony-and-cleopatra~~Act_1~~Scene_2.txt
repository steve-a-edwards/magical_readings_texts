_S_SCENE II. The same. Another room.
_D_Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer
_R_CHARMIAN
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!
_R_ALEXAS
Soothsayer!
_R_Soothsayer
Your will?
_R_CHARMIAN
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
_R_Soothsayer
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
_R_ALEXAS
Show him your hand.
_D_Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.
_R_CHARMIAN
Good sir, give me good fortune.
_R_Soothsayer
I make not, but foresee.
_R_CHARMIAN
Pray, then, foresee me one.
_R_Soothsayer
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
_R_CHARMIAN
He means in flesh.
_R_IRAS
No, you shall paint when you are old.
_R_CHARMIAN
Wrinkles forbid!
_R_ALEXAS
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
_R_CHARMIAN
Hush!
_R_Soothsayer
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
_R_CHARMIAN
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
_R_ALEXAS
Nay, hear him.
_R_CHARMIAN
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
_R_Soothsayer
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
_R_CHARMIAN
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
_R_Soothsayer
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
_R_CHARMIAN
Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
_R_Soothsayer
If every of your wishes had a womb.
And fertile every wish, a million.
_R_CHARMIAN
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
_R_ALEXAS
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
_R_CHARMIAN
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
_R_ALEXAS
We'll know all our fortunes.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
be--drunk to bed.
_R_IRAS
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
_R_CHARMIAN
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
_R_IRAS
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
_R_CHARMIAN
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.
_R_Soothsayer
Your fortunes are alike.
_R_IRAS
But how, but how? give me particulars.
_R_Soothsayer
I have said.
_R_IRAS
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
_R_CHARMIAN
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
I, where would you choose it?
_R_IRAS
Not in my husband's nose.
_R_CHARMIAN
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
_R_IRAS
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
_R_CHARMIAN
Amen.
_R_ALEXAS
Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
they'ld do't!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Hush! here comes Antony.
_R_CHARMIAN
Not he; the queen.
_D_Enter CLEOPATRA
_R_CLEOPATRA
Saw you my lord?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
No, lady.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Was he not here?
_R_CHARMIAN
No, madam.
_R_CLEOPATRA
He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Madam?
_R_CLEOPATRA
Seek him, and bring him hither.
Where's Alexas?
_R_ALEXAS
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
_R_CLEOPATRA
We will not look upon him: go with us.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
_R_Messenger
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Against my brother Lucius?
_R_Messenger
Ay:
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
Upon the first encounter, drave them.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Well, what worst?
_R_Messenger
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
_R_MARK ANTONY
When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.
_R_Messenger
Labienus--
This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
Extended Asia from Euphrates;
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
_R_MARK ANTONY
Antony, thou wouldst say,--
_R_Messenger
O, my lord!
_R_MARK ANTONY
Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
_R_Messenger
At your noble pleasure.
_D_Exit
_R_MARK ANTONY
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
_R_First Attendant
The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
_R_Second Attendant
He stays upon your will.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.
_D_Enter another Messenger
What are you?
_R_Second Messenger
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Where died she?
_R_Second Messenger
In Sicyon:
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know, this bears.
_D_Gives a letter
_R_MARK ANTONY
Forbear me.
_D_Exit Second Messenger
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
_D_Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What's your pleasure, sir?
_R_MARK ANTONY
I must with haste from hence.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
_R_MARK ANTONY
I must be gone.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
_R_MARK ANTONY
She is cunning past man's thought.
_D_Exit ALEXAS
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Would I had never seen her.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Fulvia is dead.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Sir?
_R_MARK ANTONY
Fulvia is dead.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Fulvia!
_R_MARK ANTONY
Dead.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
out, there are members to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.
_R_MARK ANTONY
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
And the business you have broached here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
wholly depends on your abode.
_R_MARK ANTONY
No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I shall do't.
_D_Exeunt
