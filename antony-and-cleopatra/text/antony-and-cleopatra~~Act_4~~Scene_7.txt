_S_SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.
_D_Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others
_R_AGRIPPA
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
_R_SCARUS
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Thou bleed'st apace.
_R_SCARUS
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.
_R_MARK ANTONY
They do retire.
_R_SCARUS
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
_D_Enter EROS
_R_EROS
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.
_R_SCARUS
Let us score their backs,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
_R_MARK ANTONY
I will reward thee
Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
For thy good valour. Come thee on.
_R_SCARUS
I'll halt after.
_D_Exeunt
