_S_SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
_D_Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
_R_CLEOPATRA
Where is the fellow?
_R_ALEXAS
Half afeard to come.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Go to, go to.
_D_Enter the Messenger as before
Come hither, sir.
_R_ALEXAS
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.
_R_CLEOPATRA
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
_R_Messenger
Most gracious majesty,--
_R_CLEOPATRA
Didst thou behold Octavia?
_R_Messenger
Ay, dread queen.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Where?
_R_Messenger
Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Is she as tall as me?
_R_Messenger
She is not, madam.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
_R_Messenger
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
_R_CLEOPATRA
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
_R_CHARMIAN
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
_R_CLEOPATRA
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
_R_Messenger
She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Is this certain?
_R_Messenger
Or I have no observance.
_R_CHARMIAN
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.
_R_CLEOPATRA
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.
_R_CHARMIAN
Excellent.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Guess at her years, I prithee.
_R_Messenger
Madam,
She was a widow,--
_R_CLEOPATRA
Widow! Charmian, hark.
_R_Messenger
And I do think she's thirty.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
_R_Messenger
Round even to faultiness.
_R_CLEOPATRA
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?
_R_Messenger
Brown, madam: and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.
_R_CLEOPATRA
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.
_D_Exit Messenger
_R_CHARMIAN
A proper man.
_R_CLEOPATRA
Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.
_R_CHARMIAN
Nothing, madam.
_R_CLEOPATRA
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
_R_CHARMIAN
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!
_R_CLEOPATRA
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.
_R_CHARMIAN
I warrant you, madam.
_D_Exeunt
