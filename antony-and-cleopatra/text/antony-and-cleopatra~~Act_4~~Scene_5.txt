_S_SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.
_D_Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them
_R_Soldier
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
_R_MARK ANTONY
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!
_R_Soldier
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Follow'd thy heels.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Who's gone this morning?
_R_Soldier
Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'
_R_MARK ANTONY
What say'st thou?
_R_Soldier
Sir,
He is with Caesar.
_R_EROS
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Is he gone?
_R_Soldier
Most certain.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
_D_Exeunt
