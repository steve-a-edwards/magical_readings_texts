_S_SCENE IV. The same. A street.
_D_Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
_R_LEPIDUS
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
Your generals after.
_R_AGRIPPA
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
_R_LEPIDUS
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
_R_MECAENAS
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
Before you, Lepidus.
_R_LEPIDUS
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about:
You'll win two days upon me.
_R_MECAENAS and AGRIPPA
Sir, good success!
_R_LEPIDUS
Farewell.
_D_Exeunt
