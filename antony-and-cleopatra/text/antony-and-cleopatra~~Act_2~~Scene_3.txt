_S_SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
_D_Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants
_R_MARK ANTONY
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.
_R_OCTAVIA
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
I have not kept my square; but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
Good night, sir.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Good night.
_D_Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
_D_Enter Soothsayer
_R_MARK ANTONY
Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
_R_Soothsayer
Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
_R_MARK ANTONY
If you can, your reason?
_R_Soothsayer
I see it in
My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
Hie you to Egypt again.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Say to me,
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
_R_Soothsayer
Caesar's.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
Make space enough between you.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Speak this no more.
_R_Soothsayer
To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But, he away, 'tis noble.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Get thee gone:
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
_D_Exit Soothsayer
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
I' the east my pleasure lies.
_D_Enter VENTIDIUS
O, come, Ventidius,
You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
Follow me, and receive't.
_D_Exeunt
