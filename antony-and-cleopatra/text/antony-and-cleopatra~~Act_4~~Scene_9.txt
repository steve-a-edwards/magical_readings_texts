_S_SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
_D_Sentinels at their post
_R_First Soldier
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to the court of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.
_R_Second Soldier
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.
_D_Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O, bear me witness, night,--
_R_Third Soldier
What man is this?
_R_Second Soldier
Stand close, and list him.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!
_R_First Soldier
Enobarbus!
_R_Third Soldier
Peace!
Hark further.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular;
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!
_D_Dies
_R_Second Soldier
Let's speak To him.
_R_First Soldier
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.
_R_Third Soldier
Let's do so. But he sleeps.
_R_First Soldier
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.
_R_Second Soldier
Go we to him.
_R_Third Soldier
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
_R_Second Soldier
Hear you, sir?
_R_First Soldier
The hand of death hath raught him.
_D_Drums afar off
Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.
_R_Third Soldier
Come on, then;
He may recover yet.
_D_Exeunt with the body
