_S_SCENE V. The same. Another room.
_D_Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
How now, friend Eros!
_R_EROS
There's strange news come, sir.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What, man?
_R_EROS
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
This is old: what is the success?
_R_EROS
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
_R_EROS
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Our great navy's rigg'd.
_R_EROS
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
'Twill be naught:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
_R_EROS
Come, sir.
_D_Exeunt
