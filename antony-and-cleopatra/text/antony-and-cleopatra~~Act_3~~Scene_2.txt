_S_SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
_D_Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another
_R_AGRIPPA
What, are the brothers parted?
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.
_R_AGRIPPA
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
_R_AGRIPPA
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
_R_AGRIPPA
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
_R_AGRIPPA
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
_R_AGRIPPA
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
_R_AGRIPPA
Both he loves.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
They are his shards, and he their beetle.
_D_Trumpets within
So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
_R_AGRIPPA
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
_D_Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
_R_MARK ANTONY
No further, sir.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Make me not offended
In your distrust.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I have said.
_R_MARK ANTONY
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
_R_OCTAVIA
My noble brother!
_R_MARK ANTONY
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
_R_OCTAVIA
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
What, Octavia?
_R_OCTAVIA
I'll tell you in your ear.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
down-feather,
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
And neither way inclines.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
_R_AGRIPPA
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.
_R_AGRIPPA
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't, till I wept too.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.
_R_MARK ANTONY
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Adieu; be happy!
_R_LEPIDUS
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
_R_OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Farewell, fa rewell!
_D_Kisses OCTAVIA
_R_MARK ANTONY
Farewell!
_D_Trumpets sound. Exeunt
