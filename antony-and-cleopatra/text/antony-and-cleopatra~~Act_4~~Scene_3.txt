_S_SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.
_D_Enter two Soldiers to their guard
_R_First Soldier
Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
_R_Second Soldier
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
_R_First Soldier
Nothing. What news?
_R_Second Soldier
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
_R_First Soldier
Well, sir, good night.
_D_Enter two other Soldiers
_R_Second Soldier
Soldiers, have careful watch.
_R_Third Soldier
And you. Good night, good night.
_D_They place themselves in every corner of the stage
_R_Fourth Soldier
Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.
_R_Third Soldier
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.
_D_Music of the hautboys as under the stage
_R_Fourth Soldier
Peace! what noise?
_R_First Soldier
List, list!
_R_Second Soldier
Hark!
_R_First Soldier
Music i' the air.
_R_Third Soldier
Under the earth.
_R_Fourth Soldier
It signs well, does it not?
_R_Third Soldier
No.
_R_First Soldier
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?
_R_Second Soldier
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.
_R_First Soldier
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
_D_They advance to another post
_R_Second Soldier
How now, masters!
_R_All
[Speaking together] How now!
How now! do you hear this?
_R_First Soldier
Ay; is't not strange?
_R_Third Soldier
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
_R_First Soldier
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
_R_All
Content. 'Tis strange.
_D_Exeunt
