_S_SCENE X. Another part of the plain.
_D_CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight
_D_Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
To see't mine eyes are blasted.
_D_Enter SCARUS
_R_SCARUS
Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What's thy passion!
_R_SCARUS
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
How appears the fight?
_R_SCARUS
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
Endure a further view.
_R_SCARUS
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Alack, alack!
_D_Enter CANIDIUS
_R_CANIDIUS
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
O, he has given example for our flight,
Most grossly, by his own!
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed.
_R_CANIDIUS
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
_R_SCARUS
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.
_R_CANIDIUS
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse: six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.
_R_DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.
_D_Exeunt
