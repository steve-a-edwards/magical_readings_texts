<h3>SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Our great competitor: from Alexandria</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">A man who is the abstract of all faults</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">That all men follow.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>LEPIDUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">I must not think there are</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Than what he chooses.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">With knaves that smell of sweat: say this</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">becomes him,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">As his composure must be rare indeed</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">No way excuse his soils, when we do bear</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">Call on him for't: but to confound such time,</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">And so rebel to judgment.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>LEPIDUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">Here's more news.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="37">Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">And it appears he is beloved of those</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">The discontents repair, and men's reports</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">Give him much wrong'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="44">I should have known no less.</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">It hath been taught us from the primal state,</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">That he which is was wish'd until he were;</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">To rot itself with motion.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="52">Caesar, I bring thee word,</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">With keels of every kind: many hot inroads</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">They make in Italy; the borders maritime</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">Than could his war resisted.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="61">Antony,</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">Though daintily brought up, with patience more</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">Which some did die to look on: and all this--</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</a><br/>
<a NAME="77">So much as lank'd not.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>LEPIDUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="78">'Tis pity of him.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="79">Let his shames quickly</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">Assemble we immediate council: Pompey</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">Thrives in our idleness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>LEPIDUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">To-morrow, Caesar,</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">Both what by sea and land I can be able</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">To front this present time.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="88">Till which encounter,</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">It is my business too. Farewell.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>LEPIDUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="90">Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">To let me be partaker.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="93">Doubt not, sir;</a><br/>
<a NAME="94">I knew it for my bond.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
