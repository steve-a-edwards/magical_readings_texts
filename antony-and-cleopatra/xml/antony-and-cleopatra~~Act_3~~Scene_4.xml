<h3>SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>MARK ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">That were excusable, that, and thousands more</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Of semblable import,--but he hath waged</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">To public ear:</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">When the best hint was given him, he not took't,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Or did it from his teeth.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>OCTAVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">O my good lord,</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">Believe not all; or, if you must believe,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">If this division chance, ne'er stood between,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Praying for both parts:</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">The good gods me presently,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">'Twixt these extremes at all.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>MARK ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">Gentle Octavia,</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">I lose myself: better I were not yours</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">I'll raise the preparation of a war</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">So your desires are yours.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>OCTAVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">Thanks to my lord.</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">As if the world should cleave, and that slain men</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Should solder up the rift.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>MARK ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">When it appears to you where this begins,</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">Can never be so equal, that your love</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Can equally move with them. Provide your going;</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">Choose your own company, and command what cost</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">Your heart has mind to.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
