<h3>SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">I have many other ways to die; meantime</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Laugh at his challenge.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>MECAENAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Caesar must think,</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Make boot of his distraction: never anger</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">Made good guard for itself.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">Let our best heads</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">We mean to fight: within our files there are,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Of those that served Mark Antony but late,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Enough to fetch him in. See it done:</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">And feast the army; we have store to do't,</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
