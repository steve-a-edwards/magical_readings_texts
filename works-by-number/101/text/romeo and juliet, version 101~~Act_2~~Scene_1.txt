_S_SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. (Reduced to 8 lines)
_D_Enter ROMEO, wearing unusually bright pink tights.
_R_ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
_D_He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
_D_Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
_R_BENVOLIO
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
_R_MERCUTIO
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
_R_BENVOLIO
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
_R_MERCUTIO
Nay, I'll conjure too.
_D_Exeunt
