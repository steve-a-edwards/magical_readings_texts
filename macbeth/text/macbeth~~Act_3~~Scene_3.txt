_S_SCENE III. A park near the palace.
_D_Enter three Murderers
_R_First Murderer
But who did bid thee join with us?
_R_Third Murderer
Macbeth.
_R_Second Murderer
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
_R_First Murderer
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.
_R_Third Murderer
Hark! I hear horses.
_R_BANQUO
[Within] Give us a light there, ho!
_R_Second Murderer
Then 'tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.
_R_First Murderer
His horses go about.
_R_Third Murderer
Almost a mile: but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.
_R_Second Murderer
A light, a light!
_D_Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch
_R_Third Murderer
'Tis he.
_R_First Murderer
Stand to't.
_R_BANQUO
It will be rain to-night.
_R_First Murderer
Let it come down.
_D_They set upon BANQUO
_R_BANQUO
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
_D_Dies. FLEANCE escapes
_R_Third Murderer
Who did strike out the light?
_R_First Murderer
Wast not the way?
_R_Third Murderer
There's but one down; the son is fled.
_R_Second Murderer
We have lost
Best half of our affair.
_R_First Murderer
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
_D_Exeunt
