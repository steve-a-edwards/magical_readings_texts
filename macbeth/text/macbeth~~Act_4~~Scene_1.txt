_S_SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.
_D_Thunder. Enter the three Witches
_R_First Witch
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
_R_Second Witch
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
_R_Third Witch
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
_R_First Witch
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
_R_ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
_R_Second Witch
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
_R_ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
_R_Third Witch
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
For the ingredients of our cauldron.
_R_ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
_R_Second Witch
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.
_D_Enter HECATE to the other three Witches
_R_HECATE
O well done! I commend your pains;
And every one shall share i' the gains;
And now about the cauldron sing,
Live elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
_D_Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' and c
_D_HECATE retires
_R_Second Witch
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!
_D_Enter MACBETH
_R_MACBETH
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?
_R_ALL
A deed without a name.
_R_MACBETH
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.
_R_First Witch
Speak.
_R_Second Witch
Demand.
_R_Third Witch
We'll answer.
_R_First Witch
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?
_R_MACBETH
Call 'em; let me see 'em.
_R_First Witch
Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw
Into the flame.
_R_ALL
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!
_D_Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head
_R_MACBETH
Tell me, thou unknown power,--
_R_First Witch
He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
_R_First Apparition
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
_D_Descends
_R_MACBETH
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
word more,--
_R_First Witch
He will not be commanded: here's another,
More potent than the first.
_D_Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child
_R_Second Apparition
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
_R_MACBETH
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
_R_Second Apparition
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.
_D_Descends
_R_MACBETH
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?
_D_Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
_R_ALL
Listen, but speak not to't.
_R_Third Apparition
Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.
_D_Descends
_R_MACBETH
That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?
_R_ALL
Seek to know no more.
_R_MACBETH
I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
_D_Hautboys
_R_First Witch
Show!
_R_Second Witch
Show!
_R_Third Witch
Show!
_R_ALL
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!
_D_A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following
_R_MACBETH
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
What, is this so?
_D_Apparitions vanish
_R_First Witch
Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights:
I'll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round:
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay.
_D_Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE
_R_MACBETH
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!
_D_Enter LENNOX
_R_LENNOX
What's your grace's will?
_R_MACBETH
Saw you the weird sisters?
_R_LENNOX
No, my lord.
_R_MACBETH
Came they not by you?
_R_LENNOX
No, indeed, my lord.
_R_MACBETH
Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
_R_LENNOX
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.
_R_MACBETH
Fled to England!
_R_LENNOX
Ay, my good lord.
_R_MACBETH
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
_D_Exeunt
