_S_SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.
_D_Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS
_R_LADY MACDUFF
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
_R_ROSS
You must have patience, madam.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.
_R_ROSS
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.
_R_ROSS
My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
_R_ROSS
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.
_D_Exit
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Sirrah, your father's dead;
And what will you do now? How will you live?
_R_Son
As birds do, mother.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
What, with worms and flies?
_R_Son
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.
_R_Son
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?
_R_Son
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
_R_Son
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
With wit enough for thee.
_R_Son
Was my father a traitor, mother?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Ay, that he was.
_R_Son
What is a traitor?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Why, one that swears and lies.
_R_Son
And be all traitors that do so?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
_R_Son
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Every one.
_R_Son
Who must hang them?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Why, the honest men.
_R_Son
Then the liars and swearers are fools,
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt thou do for a father?
_R_Son
If he were dead, you'ld weep for
him: if you would not, it were a good sign
that I should quickly have a new father.
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
_D_Enter a Messenger
_R_Messenger
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
_D_Exit
_R_LADY MACDUFF
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm?
_D_Enter Murderers
What are these faces?
_R_First Murderer
Where is your husband?
_R_LADY MACDUFF
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.
_R_First Murderer
He's a traitor.
_R_Son
Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!
_R_First Murderer
What, you egg!
_D_Stabbing him
Young fry of treachery!
_R_Son
He has kill'd me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!
_D_Dies
_D_Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her
