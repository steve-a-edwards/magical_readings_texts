_S_SCENE III. A heath near Forres.
_D_Thunder. Enter the three Witches
_R_First Witch
Where hast thou been, sister?
_R_Second Witch
Killing swine.
_R_Third Witch
Sister, where thou?
_R_First Witch
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
_R_Second Witch
I'll give thee a wind.
_R_First Witch
Thou'rt kind.
_R_Third Witch
And I another.
_R_First Witch
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.
_R_Second Witch
Show me, show me.
_R_First Witch
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
_D_Drum within
_R_Third Witch
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
_R_ALL
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! the charm's wound up.
_D_Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
_R_MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
_R_BANQUO
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
_R_MACBETH
Speak, if you can: what are you?
_R_First Witch
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
_R_Second Witch
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
_R_Third Witch
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
_R_BANQUO
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.
_R_First Witch
Hail!
_R_Second Witch
Hail!
_R_Third Witch
Hail!
_R_First Witch
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
_R_Second Witch
Not so happy, yet much happier.
_R_Third Witch
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
_R_First Witch
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
_R_MACBETH
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
_D_Witches vanish
_R_BANQUO
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
_R_MACBETH
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
_R_BANQUO
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
_R_MACBETH
Your children shall be kings.
_R_BANQUO
You shall be king.
_R_MACBETH
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
_R_BANQUO
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
_D_Enter ROSS and ANGUS
_R_ROSS
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.
_R_ANGUS
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.
_R_ROSS
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.
_R_BANQUO
What, can the devil speak true?
_R_MACBETH
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?
_R_ANGUS
Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.
_R_MACBETH
[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?
_D_To ROSS and ANGUS
_D_To BANQUO
_R_BANQUO
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
_R_MACBETH
[Aside] Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not.
_D_Aside
_R_BANQUO
Look, how our partner's rapt.
_R_MACBETH
[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.
_R_BANQUO
New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.
_R_MACBETH
[Aside] Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
_R_BANQUO
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
_R_MACBETH
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.
_R_BANQUO
Very gladly.
_R_MACBETH
Till then, enough. Come, friends.
_D_Exeunt
