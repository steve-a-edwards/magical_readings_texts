_S_SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.
_D_Enter ROSS and an old Man
_R_Old Man
Threescore and ten I can remember well:
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.
_R_ROSS
Ah, good father,
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?
_R_Old Man
'Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
_R_ROSS
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.
_R_Old Man
'Tis said they eat each other.
_R_ROSS
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
_D_Enter MACDUFF
How goes the world, sir, now?
_R_MACDUFF
Why, see you not?
_R_ROSS
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
_R_MACDUFF
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
_R_ROSS
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?
_R_MACDUFF
They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.
_R_ROSS
'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
_R_MACDUFF
He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.
_R_ROSS
Where is Duncan's body?
_R_MACDUFF
Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.
_R_ROSS
Will you to Scone?
_R_MACDUFF
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
_R_ROSS
Well, I will thither.
_R_MACDUFF
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
_R_ROSS
Farewell, father.
_R_Old Man
God's benison go with you; and with those
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!
_D_Exeunt
