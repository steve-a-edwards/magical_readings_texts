_S_SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.
_D_Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching
_R_MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.
_R_MENTEITH
We doubt it nothing.
_R_SIWARD
What wood is this before us?
_R_MENTEITH
The wood of Birnam.
_R_MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.
_R_Soldiers
It shall be done.
_R_SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down before 't.
_R_MALCOLM
'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.
_R_MACDUFF
Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.
_R_SIWARD
The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
Towards which advance the war.
_D_Exeunt, marching
