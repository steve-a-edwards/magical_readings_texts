_S_SCENE III. The same.
_D_Knocking within. Enter a Porter
_R_Porter
Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
old turning the key.
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
time; have napkins enow about you; here
you'll sweat for't.
Knock,
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
in, equivocator.
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
roast your goose.
Knock,
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in
some of all professions that go the primrose
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

_D_Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX
_R_MACDUFF
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?
_R_Porter
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.
_R_MACDUFF
What three things does drink especially provoke?
_R_Porter
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
it provokes the desire, but it takes
away the performance: therefore, much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
_R_MACDUFF
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
_R_Porter
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
think, being too strong for him, though he took
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
him.
_R_MACDUFF
Is thy master stirring?
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
_D_Enter MACBETH
_R_LENNOX
Good morrow, noble sir.
_R_MACBETH
Good morrow, both.
_R_MACDUFF
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
_R_MACBETH
Not yet.
_R_MACDUFF
He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.
_R_MACBETH
I'll bring you to him.
_R_MACDUFF
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.
_R_MACBETH
The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
_R_MACDUFF
I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.
_D_Exit
_R_LENNOX
Goes the king hence to-day?
_R_MACBETH
He does: he did appoint so.
_R_LENNOX
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
Was feverous and did shake.
_R_MACBETH
'Twas a rough night.
_R_LENNOX
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.
_D_Re-enter MACDUFF
_R_MACDUFF
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!
_R_MACBETH
_R_LENNOX
What's the matter.
_R_MACDUFF
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
The life o' the building!
_R_MACBETH
What is 't you say? the life?
_R_LENNOX
Mean you his majesty?
_R_MACDUFF
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See, and then speak yourselves.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
_D_Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
_D_Bell rings
_D_Enter LADY MACBETH
_R_LADY MACBETH
What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
_R_MACDUFF
O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master 's murder'd!
_D_Enter BANQUO
_R_LADY MACBETH
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
_R_BANQUO
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.
_D_Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS
_R_MACBETH
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There 's nothing serious in mortality:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.
_D_Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN
_R_DONALBAIN
What is amiss?
_R_MACBETH
You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
_R_MACDUFF
Your royal father 's murder'd.
_R_MALCOLM
O, by whom?
_R_LENNOX
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows:
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
Was to be trusted with them.
_R_MACBETH
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.
_R_MACDUFF
Wherefore did you so?
_R_MACBETH
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love kno wn?
_R_LADY MACBETH
Help me hence, ho!
_R_MACDUFF
Look to the lady.
_R_MALCOLM
[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?
_R_DONALBAIN
[Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
where our fate,
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
Let 's away;
Our tears are not yet brew'd.
_R_MALCOLM
[Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.
_R_BANQUO
Look to the lady:
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.
_D_LADY MACBETH is carried out
_R_MACDUFF
And so do I.
_R_ALL
So all.
_R_MACBETH
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.
_R_ALL
Well contented.
_D_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
_R_MALCOLM
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
_R_DONALBAIN
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.
_R_MALCOLM
This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
_D_Exeunt
