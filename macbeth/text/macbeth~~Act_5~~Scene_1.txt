_S_SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
_D_Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman
_R_Doctor
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
_R_Gentlewoman
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
_R_Doctor
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
time, have you heard her say?
_R_Gentlewoman
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
_R_Doctor
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
_R_Gentlewoman
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
confirm my speech.
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
_D_Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
_R_Doctor
How came she by that light?
_R_Gentlewoman
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
continually; 'tis her command.
_R_Doctor
You see, her eyes are open.
_R_Gentlewoman
Ay, but their sense is shut.
_R_Doctor
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
_R_Gentlewoman
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour.
_R_LADY MACBETH
Yet here's a spot.
_R_Doctor
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
_R_LADY MACBETH
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him.
_R_Doctor
Do you mark that?
_R_LADY MACBETH
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
this starting.
_R_Doctor
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
_R_Gentlewoman
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
that: heaven knows what she has known.
_R_LADY MACBETH
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh, oh, oh!
_R_Doctor
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
_R_Gentlewoman
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body.
_R_Doctor
Well, well, well,--
_R_Gentlewoman
Pray God it be, sir.
_R_Doctor
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds.
_R_LADY MACBETH
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
cannot come out on's grave.
_R_Doctor
Even so?
_R_LADY MACBETH
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
_D_Exit
_R_Doctor
Will she go now to bed?
_R_Gentlewoman
Directly.
_R_Doctor
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.
_R_Gentlewoman
Good night, good doctor.
_D_Exeunt
