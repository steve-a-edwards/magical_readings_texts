_S_SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
_D_Alarums. Enter MACBETH
_R_MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
_D_Enter YOUNG SIWARD
_R_YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name?
_R_MACBETH
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
_R_YOUNG SIWARD
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.
_R_MACBETH
My name's Macbeth.
_R_YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.
_R_MACBETH
No, nor more fearful.
_R_YOUNG SIWARD
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
_D_They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
_R_MACBETH
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
_D_Exit
_D_Alarums. Enter MACDUFF
_R_MACDUFF
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.
_D_Exit. Alarums
_D_Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
_R_SIWARD
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.
_R_MALCOLM
We have met with foes
That strike beside us.
_R_SIWARD
Enter, sir, the castle.
_D_Exeunt. Alarums
