<h3>SCENE I. Forres. The palace.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter BANQUO</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">As the weird women promised, and, I fear,</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">It should not stand in thy posterity,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">But that myself should be the root and father</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Of many kings. If there come truth from them--</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Why, by the verities on thee made good,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">May they not be my oracles as well,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.</a><br/>
<p><i>Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY  MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">Here's our chief guest.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>LADY MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">If he had been forgotten,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">It had been as a gap in our great feast,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">And all-thing unbecoming.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="15">To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">And I'll request your presence.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">Let your highness</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Command upon me; to the which my duties</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Are with a most indissoluble tie</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">For ever knit.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="21">                  Ride you this afternoon?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">Ay, my good lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="23">We should have else desired your good advice,</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Is't far you ride?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">I must become a borrower of the night</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">For a dark hour or twain.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">Fail not our feast.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">My lord, I will not.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="33">We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">In England and in Ireland, not confessing</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">When therewithal we shall have cause of state</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>BANQUO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="40">Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="41">I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit BANQUO</i></p>
<a NAME="43">Let every man be master of his time</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">Till seven at night: to make society</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant</i></p>
<a NAME="47">Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">Our pleasure?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>ATTENDANT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="49">They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="50">Bring them before us.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit Attendant</i></p>
<a NAME="51">To be thus is nothing;</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">To act in safety. There is none but he</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">When first they put the name of king upon me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">Given to the common enemy of man,</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">Rather than so, come fate into the list.</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!</a><br/>
<p><i>Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers</i></p>
<a NAME="76">Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit Attendant</i></p>
<a NAME="77">Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</a><br/>

<a NAME="78">It was, so please your highness.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="79">Well then, now</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">That it was he in the times past which held you</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">So under fortune, which you thought had been</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">Our innocent self: this I made good to you</a><br/>
<a NAME="84">In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">the instruments,</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</a><br/>
<a NAME="88">To half a soul and to a notion crazed</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>

<a NAME="90">You made it known to us.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="91">I did so, and went further, which is now</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">Our point of second meeting. Do you find</a><br/>
<a NAME="93">Your patience so predominant in your nature</a><br/>
<a NAME="94">That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">To pray for this good man and for his issue,</a><br/>
<a NAME="96">Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave</a><br/>
<a NAME="97">And beggar'd yours for ever?</a><br/>

<a NAME="speech22"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="99">Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</a><br/>
<a NAME="101">Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept</a><br/>
<a NAME="102">All by the name of dogs: the valued file</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">According to the gift which bounteous nature</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">Particular addition. from the bill</a><br/>
<a NAME="108">That writes them all alike: and so of men.</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">Now, if you have a station in the file,</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">And I will put that business in your bosoms,</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">Whose execution takes your enemy off,</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">Which in his death were perfect.</a><br/>
</blockquote>

<a NAME="127">So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</a><br/>

<a NAME="134">Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">That I to your assistance do make love,</a><br/>
