<h3>SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter MACBETH</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Why should I play the Roman fool, and die</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Do better upon them.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter MACDUFF</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>MACDUFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">Turn, hell-hound, turn!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="5">Of all men else I have avoided thee:</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">But get thee back; my soul is too much charged</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">With blood of thine already.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>MACDUFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">I have no words:</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Than terms can give thee out!</a><br/>
<p><i>They fight</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">Thou losest labour:</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">To one of woman born.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>MACDUFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">Despair thy charm;</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">And let the angel whom thou still hast served</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Untimely ripp'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="21">Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">For it hath cow'd my better part of man!</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">And be these juggling fiends no more believed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">That palter with us in a double sense;</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">That keep the word of promise to our ear,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>MACDUFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">Then yield thee, coward,</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">Painted on a pole, and underwrit,</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">'Here may you see the tyrant.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>MACBETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">I will not yield,</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">And to be baited with the rabble's curse.</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">And thou opposed, being of no woman born,</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Yet I will try the last. Before my body</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt, fighting. Alarums</i></p>
<p><i>Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>MALCOLM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="40">I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>SIWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="41">Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>MALCOLM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="43">Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>ROSS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="44">Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">He only lived but till he was a man;</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">In the unshrinking station where he fought,</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">But like a man he died.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>SIWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="49">Then he is dead?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>ROSS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="50">Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">Must not be measured by his worth, for then</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">It hath no end.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>SIWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="53">                  Had he his hurts before?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>ROSS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="54">Ay, on the front.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>SIWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="55">                  Why then, God's soldier be he!</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">I would not wish them to a fairer death:</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">And so, his knell is knoll'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>MALCOLM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="59">He's worth more sorrow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">And that I'll spend for him.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>SIWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="61">He's worth no more</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">They say he parted well, and paid his score:</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.</a><br/>
<p><i>Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>MACDUFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="64">Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">That speak my salutation in their minds;</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">Hail, King of Scotland!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>ALL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="70">Hail, King of Scotland!</a><br/>
<p><i>Flourish</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>MALCOLM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="71">We shall not spend a large expense of time</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">Before we reckon with your several loves,</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">In such an honour named. What's more to do,</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">Which would be planted newly with the time,</a><br/>
<a NAME="77">As calling home our exiled friends abroad</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">Producing forth the cruel ministers</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">Took off her life; this, and what needful else</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</a><br/>
<a NAME="84">We will perform in measure, time and place:</a><br/>
<a NAME="85">So, thanks to all at once and to each one,</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.</a><br/>
<p><i>Flourish. Exeunt</i></p>
