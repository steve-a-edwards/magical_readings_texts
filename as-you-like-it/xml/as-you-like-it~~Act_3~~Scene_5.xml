<h3>SCENE V. Another part of the forest.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">Say that you love me not, but say not so</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">In bitterness. The common executioner,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">But first begs pardon: will you sterner be</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">I would not be thy executioner:</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">The cicatrice and capable impressure</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">That can do hurt.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="28">                  O dear Phebe,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">If ever,--as that ever may be near,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">Then shall you know the wounds invisible</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">That love's keen arrows make.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="33">But till that time</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">As till that time I shall not pity thee.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="37">And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">That you insult, exult, and all at once,</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">As, by my faith, I see no more in you</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">Than without candle may go dark to bed--</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">I see no more in you than in the ordinary</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">That can entame my spirits to your worship.</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">You are a thousand times a properer man</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">And out of you she sees herself more proper</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">Than any of her lineaments can show her.</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="66">Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="68">He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="72">For no ill will I bear you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="73">I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">For I am falser than vows made in wine:</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</a><br/>
<a NAME="77">Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">And be not proud: though all the world could see,</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">None could be so abused in sight as he.</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">Come, to our flock.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="82">Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">Sweet Phebe,--</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="85">                  Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="86">Sweet Phebe, pity me.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="87">Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="88">Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">By giving love your sorrow and my grief</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">Were both extermined.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="92">Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="93">I would have you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="94">                  Why, that were covetousness.</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,</a><br/>
<a NAME="96">And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</a><br/>
<a NAME="97">But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="99">I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">But do not look for further recompense</a><br/>
<a NAME="101">Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="102">So holy and so perfect is my love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">And I in such a poverty of grace,</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">To glean the broken ears after the man</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="108">Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="109">Not very well, but I have met him oft;</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">That the old carlot once was master of.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="112">Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">But what care I for words? yet words do well</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="118">He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</a><br/>
<a NAME="120">Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</a><br/>
<a NAME="121">He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</a><br/>
<a NAME="122">His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">There was a pretty redness in his lip,</a><br/>
<a NAME="124">A little riper and more lusty red</a><br/>
<a NAME="125">Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">Between the constant red and mingled damask.</a><br/>
<a NAME="127">There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">In parcels as I did, would have gone near</a><br/>
<a NAME="129">To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</a><br/>
<a NAME="131">I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="132">For what had he to do to chide at me?</a><br/>
<a NAME="133">He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</a><br/>
<a NAME="134">And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">I marvel why I answer'd not again:</a><br/>
<a NAME="136">But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.</a><br/>
<a NAME="137">I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</a><br/>
<a NAME="138">And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="139">Phebe, with all my heart.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>PHEBE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="140">I'll write it straight;</a><br/>
<a NAME="141">The matter's in my head and in my heart:</a><br/>
<a NAME="142">I will be bitter with him and passing short.</a><br/>
<a NAME="143">Go with me, Silvius.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
