<h3>SCENE III. The forest.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">here much Orlando!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">sleep. Look, who comes here.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter SILVIUS</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">My errand is to you, fair youth;</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">I know not the contents; but, as I guess</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">By the stern brow and waspish action</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Which she did use as she was writing of it,</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">I am but as a guiltless messenger.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="13">Patience herself would startle at this letter</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">This is a letter of your own device.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="21">No, I protest, I know not the contents:</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">Phebe did write it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="23">Come, come, you are a fool</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">And turn'd into the extremity of love.</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">I say she never did invent this letter;</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">This is a man's invention and his hand.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">Sure, it is hers.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="38">So please you, for I never heard it yet;</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="40">She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.</a><br/>
<p><i>Reads</i></p>
<a NAME="41">Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">Can a woman rail thus?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="44">Call you this railing?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="45">[Reads]</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">Why, thy godhead laid apart,</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">Did you ever hear such railing?</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">That could do no vengeance to me.</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">Meaning me a beast.</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">If the scorn of your bright eyne</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">Have power to raise such love in mine,</a><br/>
<a NAME="54">Alack, in me what strange effect</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">Would they work in mild aspect!</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">Whiles you chid me, I did love;</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">How then might your prayers move!</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">He that brings this love to thee</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">Little knows this love in me:</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">And by him seal up thy mind;</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">Whether that thy youth and kind</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">Will the faithful offer take</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">Of me and all that I can make;</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">Or else by him my love deny,</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">And then I'll study how to die.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>SILVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="66">Call you this chiding?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="67">Alas, poor shepherd!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="68">Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">her: that if she love me, I charge her to love</a><br/>
<a NAME="74">thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit SILVIUS</i></p>
<p><i>Enter OLIVER</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="77">Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="80">West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">But at this hour the house doth keep itself;</a><br/>
<a NAME="84">There's none within.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="85">If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">Then should I know you by description;</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,</a><br/>
<a NAME="88">Of female favour, and bestows himself</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">Like a ripe sister: the woman low</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">And browner than her brother.' Are not you</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">The owner of the house I did inquire for?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="92">It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="93">Orlando doth commend him to you both,</a><br/>
<a NAME="94">And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="96">I am: what must we understand by this?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="97">Some of my shame; if you will know of me</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">What man I am, and how, and why, and where</a><br/>
<a NAME="99">This handkercher was stain'd.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="100">I pray you, tell it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="101">When last the young Orlando parted from you</a><br/>
<a NAME="102">He left a promise to return again</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">And mark what object did present itself:</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age</a><br/>
<a NAME="108">And high top bald with dry antiquity,</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">And with indented glides did slip away</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">Into a bush: under which bush's shade</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</a><br/>
<a NAME="118">Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</a><br/>
<a NAME="120">The royal disposition of that beast</a><br/>
<a NAME="121">To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:</a><br/>
<a NAME="122">This seen, Orlando did approach the man</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="124">O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</a><br/>
<a NAME="125">And he did render him the most unnatural</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">That lived amongst men.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="127">And well he might so do,</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">For well I know he was unnatural.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="129">But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="131">Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</a><br/>
<a NAME="132">But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</a><br/>
<a NAME="133">And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</a><br/>
<a NAME="134">Made him give battle to the lioness,</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling</a><br/>
<a NAME="136">From miserable slumber I awaked.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="137">Are you his brother?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="138">Wast you he rescued?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="139">Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="140">'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame</a><br/>
<a NAME="141">To tell you what I was, since my conversion</a><br/>
<a NAME="142">So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="143">But, for the bloody napkin?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="144">By and by.</a><br/>
<a NAME="145">When from the first to last betwixt us two</a><br/>
<a NAME="146">Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="147">As how I came into that desert place:--</a><br/>
<a NAME="148">In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</a><br/>
<a NAME="149">Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</a><br/>
<a NAME="150">Committing me unto my brother's love;</a><br/>
<a NAME="151">Who led me instantly unto his cave,</a><br/>
<a NAME="152">There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</a><br/>
<a NAME="153">The lioness had torn some flesh away,</a><br/>
<a NAME="154">Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</a><br/>
<a NAME="155">And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</a><br/>
<a NAME="156">Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</a><br/>
<a NAME="157">And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</a><br/>
<a NAME="158">He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</a><br/>
<a NAME="159">To tell this story, that you might excuse</a><br/>
<a NAME="160">His broken promise, and to give this napkin</a><br/>
<a NAME="161">Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</a><br/>
<a NAME="162">That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</a><br/>
<p><i>ROSALIND swoons</i></p>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="164">Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</a><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a NAME="165">There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!</a><br/>

<a NAME="166">Look, he recovers.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech39"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>

<blockquote>
<a NAME="170">Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a</a><br/>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech42"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="172">I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would</a><br/>
<a NAME="173">think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell</a><br/>
<a NAME="174">your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech43"><b>OLIVER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="175">This was not counterfeit: there is too great</a><br/>
<a NAME="176">testimony in your complexion that it was a passion</a><br/>
<a NAME="177">of earnest.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech44"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>

<a NAME="178">Counterfeit, I assure you.</a><br/>
