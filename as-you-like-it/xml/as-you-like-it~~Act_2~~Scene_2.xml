<i>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>DUKE FREDERICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Can it be possible that no man saw them?</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">It cannot be: some villains of my court</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Are of consent and sufferance in this.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">I cannot hear of any that did see her.</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Saw her abed, and in the morning early</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">Confesses that she secretly o'erheard</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">Your daughter and her cousin much commend</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">The parts and graces of the wrestler</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">And she believes, wherever they are gone,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">That youth is surely in their company.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>DUKE FREDERICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">If he be absent, bring his brother to me;</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">And let not search and inquisition quail</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">To bring again these foolish runaways.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
