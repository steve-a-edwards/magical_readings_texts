<h3>SCENE IV. The forest.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Never talk to me; I will weep.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">that tears do not become a man.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">But have I not cause to weep?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="5">As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Judas's own children.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="9">I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="10">An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">of holy bread.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="13">He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">the very ice of chastity is in them.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="16">But why did he swear he would come this morning, and</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">comes not?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="18">Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="19">Do you think so?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="20">Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">think him as concave as a covered goblet or a</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">worm-eaten nut.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="24">Not true in love?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="25">Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="26">You have heard him swear downright he was.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">here in the forest on the duke your father.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="31">I met the duke yesterday and had much question with</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">man as Orlando?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="36">O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">guides. Who comes here?</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter CORIN</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>CORIN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="43">Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">After the shepherd that complain'd of love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">That was his mistress.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>CELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="48">Well, and what of him?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>CORIN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="49">If you will see a pageant truly play'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">Between the pale complexion of true love</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">If you will mark it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>ROSALIND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="54">O, come, let us remove:</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">Bring us to this sight, and you shall say</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">I'll prove a busy actor in their play.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
