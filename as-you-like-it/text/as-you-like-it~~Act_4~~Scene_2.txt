_S_SCENE II. The forest.
_D_Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters
_R_JAQUES
Which is he that killed the deer?
_R_A Lord
Sir, it was I.
_R_JAQUES
Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
you no song, forester, for this purpose?
_R_Forester
Yes, sir.
_R_JAQUES
Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
make noise enough.
SONG.
_R_Forester
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
Then sing him home;
_D_The rest shall bear this burden
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
It was a crest ere thou wast born:
Thy father's father wore it,
And thy father bore it:
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
_D_Exeunt
