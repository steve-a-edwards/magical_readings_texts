_S_SCENE V. The Forest.
_D_Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others. Sings.
_R_AMIENS
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
_R_JAQUES
More, more, I prithee, more.
_R_AMIENS
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
_R_JAQUES
I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.
_R_AMIENS
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
_R_JAQUES
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
_R_AMIENS
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
_R_JAQUES
Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
nothing. Will you sing?
_R_AMIENS
More at your request than to please myself.
_R_JAQUES
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
not, hold your tongues.
_R_AMIENS
Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
this day to look you.
_R_JAQUES
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
too disputable for my company: I think of as many
matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
boast of them. Come, warble, come.
SONG.
Who doth ambition shun
_D_All together here
And loves to live i' the sun,
Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
_R_JAQUES
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention.
_R_AMIENS
And I'll sing it.
_R_JAQUES
Thus it goes:--
If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass,
Leaving his wealth and ease,
A stubborn will to please,
Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
Here shall he see
Gross fools as he,
An if he will come to me.
_R_AMIENS
What's that 'ducdame'?
_R_JAQUES
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
_R_AMIENS
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
_D_Exeunt severally
