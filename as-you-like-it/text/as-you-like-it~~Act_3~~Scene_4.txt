_S_SCENE IV. The forest.
_D_Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
_R_ROSALIND
Never talk to me; I will weep.
_R_CELIA
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.
_R_ROSALIND
But have I not cause to weep?
_R_CELIA
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
_R_ROSALIND
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
_R_CELIA
Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
Judas's own children.
_R_ROSALIND
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
_R_CELIA
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
_R_ROSALIND
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread.
_R_CELIA
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
the very ice of chastity is in them.
_R_ROSALIND
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
comes not?
_R_CELIA
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
_R_ROSALIND
Do you think so?
_R_CELIA
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.
_R_ROSALIND
Not true in love?
_R_CELIA
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
_R_ROSALIND
You have heard him swear downright he was.
_R_CELIA
'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.
_R_ROSALIND
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
man as Orlando?
_R_CELIA
O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
guides. Who comes here?
_D_Enter CORIN
_R_CORIN
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.
_R_CELIA
Well, and what of him?
_R_CORIN
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
If you will mark it.
_R_ROSALIND
O, come, let us remove:
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
_D_Exeunt
