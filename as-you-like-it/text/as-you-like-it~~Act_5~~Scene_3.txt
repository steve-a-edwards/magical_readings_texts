_S_SCENE III. The forest.
_D_Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
_R_TOUCHSTONE
To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
we be married.
_R_AUDREY
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.
_D_Enter two Pages
_R_First Page
Well met, honest gentleman.
_R_TOUCHSTONE
By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
_R_Second Page
We are for you: sit i' the middle.
_R_First Page
Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
prologues to a bad voice?
_R_Second Page
I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
gipsies on a horse.
SONG.
It was a lover and his lass,
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
That o'er the green corn-field did pass
In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye,
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
These pretty country folks would lie,
In spring time, and c.
This carol they began that hour,
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
How that a life was but a flower
In spring time, and c.
And therefore take the present time,
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
For love is crowned with the prime
In spring time, and c.
_R_TOUCHSTONE
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
untuneable.
_R_First Page
You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
_R_TOUCHSTONE
By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
your voices! Come, Audrey.
_D_Exeunt
