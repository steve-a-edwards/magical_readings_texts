_S_SCENE III. A room in the palace.
_D_Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
_R_CELIA
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
_R_ROSALIND
Not one to throw at a dog.
_R_CELIA
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
_R_ROSALIND
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any.
_R_CELIA
But is all this for your father?
_R_ROSALIND
No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
full of briers is this working-day world!
_R_CELIA
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.
_R_ROSALIND
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
_R_CELIA
Hem them away.
_R_ROSALIND
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
_R_CELIA
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
_R_ROSALIND
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
_R_CELIA
O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
_R_ROSALIND
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
_R_CELIA
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.
_R_ROSALIND
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
_R_CELIA
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
_R_ROSALIND
Let me love him for that, and do you love him
because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
_R_CELIA
With his eyes full of anger.
_D_Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court.
_R_ROSALIND
Me, uncle?
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
You, cousin
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
So near our public court as twenty miles,
Thou diest for it.
_R_ROSALIND
I do beseech your grace,
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
_R_ROSALIND
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
_R_ROSALIND
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.
_R_CELIA
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.
_R_CELIA
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
_R_CELIA
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
I cannot live out of her company.
_R_DUKE FREDERICK
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
_D_Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
_R_CELIA
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
_R_ROSALIND
I have more cause.
_R_CELIA
Thou hast not, cousin;
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
_R_ROSALIND
That he hath not.
_R_CELIA
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
_R_ROSALIND
Why, whither shall we go?
_R_CELIA
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
_R_ROSALIND
Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
_R_CELIA
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.
_R_ROSALIND
Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.
_R_CELIA
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
_R_ROSALIND
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?
_R_CELIA
Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia, but Aliena.
_R_ROSALIND
But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
_R_CELIA
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.
_D_Exeunt
