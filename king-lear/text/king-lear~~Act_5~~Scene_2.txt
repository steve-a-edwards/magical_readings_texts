Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:

Grace go with you, sir!

Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.

Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
Ripeness is all: come on.

And that's true too.
