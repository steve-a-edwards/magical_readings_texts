_S_SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep.
_D_Enter CORDELIA, KENT disguised, gentleman and Doctor
_R_CORDELIA
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.
_R_KENT
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
All my reports go with the modest truth;
Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
_R_CORDELIA
Be better suited:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
I prithee, put them off.
_R_KENT
Pardon me, dear madam;
Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
My boon I make it, that you know me not
Till time and I think meet.
_R_CORDELIA
Then be't so, my good lord.
_D_To the Doctor
How does the king?
_R_Doctor
Madam, sleeps still.
_R_CORDELIA
O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
Of this child-changed father!
_R_Doctor
So please your majesty
That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
_R_CORDELIA
Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
_R_Gentleman
Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
We put fresh garments on him.
_R_Doctor
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
I doubt not of his temperance.
_R_CORDELIA
Very well.
_R_Doctor
Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
_R_CORDELIA
O my dear father! Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!
_R_KENT
Kind and dear princess!
_R_CORDELIA
Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
_R_Doctor
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
_R_CORDELIA
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
_R_KING LEAR
You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like moulten lead.
_R_CORDELIA
Sir, do you know me?
_R_KING LEAR
You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
_R_CORDELIA
Still, still, far wide!
_R_Doctor
He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
_R_KING LEAR
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
Of my condition!
_R_CORDELIA
O, look upon me, sir,
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
No, sir, you must not kneel.
_R_KING LEAR
Pray, do not mock me:
I am a very foolish fond old man,
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For, as I am a man, I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia.
_R_CORDELIA
And so I am, I am.
_R_KING LEAR
Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
You have some cause, they have not.
_R_CORDELIA
No cause, no cause.
_R_KING LEAR
Am I in France?
_R_KENT
In your own kingdom, sir.
_R_KING LEAR
Do not abuse me.
_R_Doctor
Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
Till further settling.
_R_CORDELIA
Will't please your highness walk?
_R_KING LEAR
You must bear with me:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
_D_Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman
_R_Gentleman
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
_R_KENT
Most certain, sir.
_R_Gentleman
Who is conductor of his people?
_R_KENT
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
_R_Gentleman
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
of Kent in Germany.
_R_KENT
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
powers of the kingdom approach apace.
_R_Gentleman
The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
well, sir.
_D_Exit
_R_KENT
My point and period will be throughly wrought,
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
_D_Exit
