_S_SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
_D_Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
_R_CORNWALL
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
_R_EDMUND
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
of.
_R_CORNWALL
I now perceive, it was not altogether your
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
badness in himself.
_R_EDMUND
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
or not I the detector!
_R_CORNWALL
o with me to the duchess.
_R_EDMUND
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
mighty business in hand.
_R_CORNWALL
True or false, it hath made thee earl of
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
may be ready for our apprehension.
_R_EDMUND
[Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
between that and my blood.
_R_CORNWALL
I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love.
_D_Exeunt
