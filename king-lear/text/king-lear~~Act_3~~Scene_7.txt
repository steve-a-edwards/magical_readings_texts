_S_SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.
_D_Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants
_R_CORNWALL
Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
out the villain Gloucester.
_D_Exeunt some of the Servants
_R_REGAN
Hang him instantly.
_R_GONERIL
Pluck out his eyes.
_R_CORNWALL
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
lord of Gloucester.
_D_Enter OSWALD
How now! where's the king?
_R_OSWALD
My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
To have well-armed friends.
_R_CORNWALL
Get horses for your mistress.
_R_GONERIL
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
_R_CORNWALL
Edmund, farewell.
_D_Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
_D_Exeunt other Servants
Though well we may not pass upon his life
Without the form of justice, yet our power
Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
_D_Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three
_R_REGAN
Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
_R_CORNWALL
Bind fast his corky arms.
_R_GLOUCESTER
What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
_R_CORNWALL
Bind him, I say.
_D_Servants bind him
_R_REGAN
Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
_R_GLOUCESTER
Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
_R_CORNWALL
To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
_D_REGAN plucks his beard
_R_GLOUCESTER
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
To pluck me by the beard.
_R_REGAN
So white, and such a traitor!
_R_GLOUCESTER
Naughty lady,
These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
_R_CORNWALL
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
_R_REGAN
Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
_R_CORNWALL
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?
_R_REGAN
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
_R_GLOUCESTER
I have a letter guessingly set down,
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
And not from one opposed.
_R_CORNWALL
Cunning.
_R_REGAN
And false.
_R_CORNWALL
Where hast thou sent the king?
_R_GLOUCESTER
To Dover.
_R_REGAN
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
_R_CORNWALL
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
_R_GLOUCESTER
I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
_R_REGAN
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
_R_GLOUCESTER
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
And quench'd the stelled fires:
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children.
_R_CORNWALL
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
_R_GLOUCESTER
He that will think to live till he be old,
Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
_R_REGAN
One side will mock another; the other too.
_R_CORNWALL
If you see vengeance,--
_R_First Servant
Hold your hand, my lord:
I have served you ever since I was a child;
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold.
_R_REGAN
How now, you dog!
_R_First Servant
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
_R_CORNWALL
My villain!
_D_They draw and fight
_R_First Servant
Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
_R_REGAN
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
_D_Takes a sword, and runs at him behind
_R_First Servant
O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
To see some mischief on him. O!
_D_Dies
_R_CORNWALL
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
Where is thy lustre now?
_R_GLOUCESTER
All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
To quit this horrid act.
_R_REGAN
Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.
_R_GLOUCESTER
O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
_R_REGAN
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover.
_D_Exit one with GLOUCESTER
How is't, my lord? how look you?
_R_CORNWALL
I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
_D_Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN
_R_Second Servant
I'll never care what wickedness I do,
If this man come to good.
_R_Third Servant
If she live long,
And in the end meet the old course of death,
Women will all turn monsters.
_R_Second Servant
Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
Allows itself to any thing.
_R_Third Servant
Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!
_D_Exeunt severally
