_S_SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.
_D_Enter KENT and a Gentleman
_R_KENT
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
know you the reason?
_R_Gentleman
Something he left imperfect in the
state, which since his coming forth is thought
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger, that his personal return was
most required and necessary.
_R_KENT
Who hath he left behind him general?
_R_Gentleman
The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
_R_KENT
Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief?
_R_Gentleman
Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king o'er her.
_R_KENT
O, then it moved her.
_R_Gentleman
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
If all could so become it.
_R_KENT
Made she no verbal question?
_R_Gentleman
'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
To deal with grief alone.
_R_KENT
It is the stars,
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
_R_Gentleman
No.
_R_KENT
Was this before the king return'd?
_R_Gentleman
No, since.
_R_KENT
Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
What we are come about, and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter.
_R_Gentleman
Why, good sir?
_R_KENT
A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
His mind so venomously, that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia.
_R_Gentleman
Alack, poor gentleman!
_R_KENT
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
_R_Gentleman
'Tis so, they are afoot.
_R_KENT
Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
Along with me.
_D_Exeunt
