_S_SCENE V. Court before the same.
_D_Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
_R_KING LEAR
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
_R_KENT
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
your letter.
_D_Exit
_R_Fool
If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
danger of kibes?
_R_KING LEAR
Ay, boy.
_R_Fool
Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
slip-shod.
_R_KING LEAR
Ha, ha, ha!
_R_Fool
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
_R_KING LEAR
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
_R_Fool
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
the middle on's face?
_R_KING LEAR
No.
_R_Fool
Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
_R_KING LEAR
I did her wrong--
_R_Fool
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
_R_KING LEAR
No.
_R_Fool
Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
_R_KING LEAR
Why?
_R_Fool
Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
_R_KING LEAR
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
horses ready?
_R_Fool
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
_R_KING LEAR
Because they are not eight?
_R_Fool
Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
_R_KING LEAR
To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
_R_Fool
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
for being old before thy time.
_R_KING LEAR
How's that?
_R_Fool
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise.
_R_KING LEAR
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
_D_Enter Gentleman
How now! are the horses ready?
_R_Gentleman
Ready, my lord.
_R_KING LEAR
Come, boy.
_R_Fool
She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
_D_Exeunt
