<h3>SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>GONERIL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>OSWALD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">Yes, madam.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>GONERIL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">By day and night he wrongs me; every hour</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">He flashes into one gross crime or other,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">I will not speak with him; say I am sick:</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">If you come slack of former services,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>OSWALD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">He's coming, madam; I hear him.</a><br/>
<p><i>Horns within</i></p>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>GONERIL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">Put on what weary negligence you please,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">If he dislike it, let him to our sister,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">That still would manage those authorities</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">That he hath given away! Now, by my life,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Old fools are babes again; and must be used</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">Remember what I tell you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>OSWALD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="22">Well, madam.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>GONERIL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="23">And let his knights have colder looks among you;</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
