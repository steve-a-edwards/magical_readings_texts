<h3>SCENE I. A heath.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Who's there, besides foul weather?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">One minded like the weather, most unquietly.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">I know you. Where's the king?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">Contending with the fretful element:</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">And bids what will take all.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="16">But who is with him?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">None but the fool; who labours to out-jest</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">His heart-struck injuries.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="19">Sir, I do know you;</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">And dare, upon the warrant of my note,</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">Although as yet the face of it be cover'd</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Who have--as who have not, that their great stars</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">Which are to France the spies and speculations</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Or the hard rein which both of them have borne</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">Against the old kind king; or something deeper,</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">But, true it is, from France there comes a power</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">In some of our best ports, and are at point</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">To show their open banner. Now to you:</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">If on my credit you dare build so far</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</a><br/>
<a NAME="39">Some that will thank you, making just report</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">The king hath cause to plain.</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">This office to you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="45">I will talk further with you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="46">No, do not.</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">For confirmation that I am much more</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">And she will tell you who your fellow is</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!</a><br/>
<a NAME="53">I will go seek the king.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="54">Give me your hand: have you no more to say?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>KENT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="55">Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain</a><br/>
<a NAME="57">That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">Holla the other.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt severally</i></p>
