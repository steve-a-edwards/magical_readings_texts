<h3>SCENE III. A wood.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter EDGAR</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>EDGAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">I heard myself proclaim'd;</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">And by the happy hollow of a tree</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">That guard, and most unusual vigilance,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">I will preserve myself: and am bethought</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">To take the basest and most poorest shape</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">That ever penury, in contempt of man,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">And with presented nakedness out-face</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">The winds and persecutions of the sky.</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">The country gives me proof and precedent</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">And with this horrible object, from low farms,</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.</a><br/>
