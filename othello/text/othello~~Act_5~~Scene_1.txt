_S_SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.
_D_Enter IAGO and RODERIGO
_R_IAGO
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.
_R_RODERIGO
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
_R_IAGO
Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
_D_Retires
_R_RODERIGO
I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
_R_IAGO
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
_D_Enter CASSIO
_R_RODERIGO
I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
_D_Makes a pass at CASSIO
_R_CASSIO
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st
I will make proof of thine.
_D_Draws, and wounds RODERIGO
_R_RODERIGO
O, I am slain!
_D_IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit
_R_CASSIO
I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!
_D_Falls
_D_Enter OTHELLO
_R_OTHELLO
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
_R_RODERIGO
O, villain that I am!
_R_OTHELLO
It is even so.
_R_CASSIO
O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!
_R_OTHELLO
'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
_D_Exit
_D_Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO
_R_CASSIO
What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!
_R_GRATIANO
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
_R_CASSIO
O, help!
_R_LODOVICO
Hark!
_R_RODERIGO
O wretched villain!
_R_LODOVICO
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
To come in to the cry without more help.
_R_RODERIGO
Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
_R_LODOVICO
Hark!
_D_Re-enter IAGO, with a light
_R_GRATIANO
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
_R_IAGO
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
_R_LODOVICO
We do not know.
_R_IAGO
Did not you hear a cry?
_R_CASSIO
Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
_R_IAGO
What's the matter?
_R_GRATIANO
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
_R_LODOVICO
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
_R_IAGO
What are you here that cry so grievously?
_R_CASSIO
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
_R_IAGO
O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
_R_CASSIO
I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.
_R_IAGO
O treacherous villains!
What are you there? come in, and give some help.
_D_To LODOVICO and GRATIANO
_R_RODERIGO
O, help me here!
_R_CASSIO
That's one of them.
_R_IAGO
O murderous slave! O villain!
_D_Stabs RODERIGO
_R_RODERIGO
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
_R_IAGO
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
What may you be? are you of good or evil?
_R_LODOVICO
As you shall prove us, praise us.
_R_IAGO
Signior Lodovico?
_R_LODOVICO
He, sir.
_R_IAGO
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
_R_GRATIANO
Cassio!
_R_IAGO
How is't, brother!
_R_CASSIO
My leg is cut in two.
_R_IAGO
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
_D_Enter BIANCA
_R_BIANCA
What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?
_R_IAGO
Who is't that cried!
_R_BIANCA
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
Cassio, Cassio!
_R_IAGO
O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
Who they should be that have thus many led you?
_R_CASSIO
No.
_R_GRATIANO
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
_R_IAGO
Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
To bear him easily hence!
_R_BIANCA
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
_R_IAGO
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.
_R_GRATIANO
What, of Venice?
_R_IAGO
Even he, sir; did you know him?
_R_GRATIANO
Know him! ay.
_R_IAGO
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
That so neglected you.
_R_GRATIANO
I am glad to see you.
_R_IAGO
How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
_R_GRATIANO
Roderigo!
_R_IAGO
He, he 'tis he.
_D_A chair brought in
O, that's well said; the chair!
_R_GRATIANO
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
_D_To BIANCA
For you, mistress,
Save you your labour. He that lies slain
here, Cassio,
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?
_R_CASSIO
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
_R_IAGO
[To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
o' the air.
_D_CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
Though tongues were out of use.
_D_Enter EMILIA
_R_EMILIA
'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?
_R_IAGO
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
_R_EMILIA
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
_R_IAGO
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
_D_To BIANCA
What, do you shake at that?
_R_BIANCA
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
_R_IAGO
O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
_R_EMILIA
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
_R_BIANCA
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.
_R_EMILIA
As I! foh! fie upon thee!
_R_IAGO
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
Will you go on? I pray.
_D_Aside
This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
_D_Exeunt
