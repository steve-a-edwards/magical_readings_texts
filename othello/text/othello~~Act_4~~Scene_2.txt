_S_SCENE II. A room in the castle.
_D_Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA
_R_OTHELLO
You have seen nothing then?
_R_EMILIA
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
_R_OTHELLO
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
_R_EMILIA
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.
_R_OTHELLO
What, did they never whisper?
_R_EMILIA
Never, my lord.
_R_OTHELLO
Nor send you out o' the way?
_R_EMILIA
Never.
_R_OTHELLO
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
_R_EMILIA
Never, my lord.
_R_OTHELLO
That's strange.
_R_EMILIA
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.
_R_OTHELLO
Bid her come hither: go.
_D_Exit EMILIA
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
_D_Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA
_R_DESDEMONA
My lord, what is your will?
_R_OTHELLO
Pray, chuck, come hither.
_R_DESDEMONA
What is your pleasure?
_R_OTHELLO
Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.
_R_DESDEMONA
What horrible fancy's this?
_R_OTHELLO
[To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.
_D_Exit EMILIA
_R_DESDEMONA
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words.
But not the words.
_R_OTHELLO
Why, what art thou?
_R_DESDEMONA
Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.
_R_OTHELLO
Come, swear it, damn thyself
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
Swear thou art honest.
_R_DESDEMONA
Heaven doth truly know it.
_R_OTHELLO
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
_R_DESDEMONA
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
_R_OTHELLO
O Desdemona! away! away! away!
_R_DESDEMONA
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.
_R_OTHELLO
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live, or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
Ay, there, look grim as hell!
_R_DESDEMONA
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
_R_OTHELLO
O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
ne'er been born!
_R_DESDEMONA
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
_R_OTHELLO
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
And will not hear it. What committed!
Impudent strumpet!
_R_DESDEMONA
By heaven, you do me wrong.
_R_OTHELLO
Are you not a strumpet?
_R_DESDEMONA
No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
_R_OTHELLO
What, not a whore?
_R_DESDEMONA
No, as I shall be saved.
_R_OTHELLO
Is't possible?
_R_DESDEMONA
O, heaven forgive us!
_R_OTHELLO
I cry you mercy, then:
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello.
_D_Raising his voice
You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
_D_Re-enter EMILIA
You, you, ay, you!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
_D_Exit
_R_EMILIA
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?
_R_DESDEMONA
'Faith, half asleep.
_R_EMILIA
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
_R_DESDEMONA
With who?
_R_EMILIA
Why, with my lord, madam.
_R_DESDEMONA
Who is thy lord?
_R_EMILIA
He that is yours, sweet lady.
_R_DESDEMONA
I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.
_R_EMILIA
Here's a change indeed!
_D_Exit
_R_DESDEMONA
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
_D_Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO
_R_IAGO
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is't with you?
_R_DESDEMONA
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.
_R_IAGO
What's the matter, lady?
_R_EMILIA
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.
_R_DESDEMONA
Am I that name, Iago?
_R_IAGO
What name, fair lady?
_R_DESDEMONA
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
_R_EMILIA
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
_R_IAGO
Why did he so?
_R_DESDEMONA
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
_R_IAGO
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
_R_EMILIA
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?
_R_DESDEMONA
It is my wretched fortune.
_R_IAGO
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?
_R_DESDEMONA
Nay, heaven doth know.
_R_EMILIA
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
_R_IAGO
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
_R_DESDEMONA
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
_R_EMILIA
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!
_R_IAGO
Speak within door.
_R_EMILIA
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
_R_IAGO
You are a fool; go to.
_R_DESDEMONA
O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
_R_IAGO
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
The business of the state does him offence,
And he does chide with you.
_R_DESDEMONA
If 'twere no other--
_R_IAGO
'Tis but so, I warrant.
_D_Trumpets within
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
_D_Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
_D_Enter RODERIGO
How now, Roderigo!
_R_RODERIGO
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
_R_IAGO
What in the contrary?
_R_RODERIGO
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered.
_R_IAGO
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
_R_RODERIGO
'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
performances are no kin together.
_R_IAGO
You charge me most unjustly.
_R_RODERIGO
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
my means. The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
_R_IAGO
Well; go to; very well.
_R_RODERIGO
Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
to find myself fobbed in it.
_R_IAGO
Very well.
_R_RODERIGO
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
will seek satisfaction of you.
_R_IAGO
You have said now.
_R_RODERIGO
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
_R_IAGO
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
_R_RODERIGO
It hath not appeared.
_R_IAGO
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life.
_R_RODERIGO
Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
_R_IAGO
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
_R_RODERIGO
Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice.
_R_IAGO
O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
_R_RODERIGO
How do you mean, removing of him?
_R_IAGO
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
knocking out his brains.
_R_RODERIGO
And that you would have me to do?
_R_IAGO
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
to waste: about it.
_R_RODERIGO
I will hear further reason for this.
_R_IAGO
And you shall be satisfied.
_D_Exeunt
