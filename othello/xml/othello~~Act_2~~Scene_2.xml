<a NAME="speech1"><b>Herald</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and</a><br/>
<a NAME="6">revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">beneficial news, it is the celebration of his</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">liberty of feasting from this present hour of five</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
