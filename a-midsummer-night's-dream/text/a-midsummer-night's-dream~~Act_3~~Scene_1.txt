_S_SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
_D_Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
_R_BOTTOM
Are we all met?
_R_QUINCE
Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
_R_BOTTOM
Peter Quince,--
_R_QUINCE
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
_R_BOTTOM
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?
_R_SNOUT
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
_R_STARVELING
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
_R_BOTTOM
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
out of fear.
_R_QUINCE
Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
written in eight and six.
_R_BOTTOM
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
_R_SNOUT
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
_R_STARVELING
I fear it, I promise you.
_R_BOTTOM
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to 't.
_R_SNOUT
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
_R_BOTTOM
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
_R_QUINCE
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
_R_SNOUT
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
_R_BOTTOM
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.
_R_QUINCE
Yes, it doth shine that night.
_R_BOTTOM
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.
_R_QUINCE
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.
_R_SNOUT
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
_R_BOTTOM
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.
_R_QUINCE
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
according to his cue.
_D_Enter PUCK behind
_R_PUCK
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
_R_QUINCE
Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
_R_BOTTOM
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
_R_QUINCE
Odours, odours.
_R_BOTTOM
--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.
_D_Exit
_R_PUCK
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
_D_Exit
_R_FLUTE
Must I speak now?
_R_QUINCE
Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
_R_FLUTE
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
_R_QUINCE
'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
is past; it is, 'never tire.'
_R_FLUTE
O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
never tire.
_D_Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head
_R_BOTTOM
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
_R_QUINCE
O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
masters! fly, masters! Help!
_D_Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
_R_PUCK
I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
_D_Exit
_R_BOTTOM
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
make me afeard.
_D_Re-enter SNOUT
_R_SNOUT
O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
_R_BOTTOM
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
you?
_D_Exit SNOUT
_D_Re-enter QUINCE
_R_QUINCE
Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
translated.
_D_Exit
_R_BOTTOM
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
I am not afraid.
_D_Sings
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill,--
_R_TITANIA
[Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
_R_BOTTOM
[Sings]
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
The plain-song cuckoo gray,
Whose note full many a man doth mark,
And dares not answer nay;--
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
'cuckoo' never so?
_R_TITANIA
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
_R_BOTTOM
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
_R_TITANIA
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
_R_BOTTOM
Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
_R_TITANIA
Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
_D_Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED
_R_PEASEBLOSSOM
Ready.
_R_COBWEB
And I.
_R_MOTH
And I.
_R_MUSTARDSEED
And I.
_R_ALL
Where shall we go?
_R_TITANIA
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
_R_PEASEBLOSSOM
Hail, mortal!
_R_COBWEB
Hail!
_R_MOTH
Hail!
_R_MUSTARDSEED
Hail!
_R_BOTTOM
I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
worship's name.
_R_COBWEB
Cobweb.
_R_BOTTOM
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
you. Your name, honest gentleman?
_R_PEASEBLOSSOM
Peaseblossom.
_R_BOTTOM
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
_R_MUSTARDSEED
Mustardseed.
_R_BOTTOM
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
desire your more acquaintance, good Master
Mustardseed.
_R_TITANIA
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
_D_Exeunt
