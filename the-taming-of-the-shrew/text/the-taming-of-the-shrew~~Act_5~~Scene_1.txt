_S_SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.
_D_GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA
_R_BIONDELLO
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
_R_LUCENTIO
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.
_R_BIONDELLO
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
_D_Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
_R_GREMIO
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
_D_Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants
_R_PETRUCHIO
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
_R_VINCENTIO
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
_D_Knocks
_R_GREMIO
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
_D_Pedant looks out of the window
_R_Pedant
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
_R_VINCENTIO
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
_R_Pedant
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
_R_VINCENTIO
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?
_R_Pedant
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
_R_Pedant
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.
_R_VINCENTIO
Art thou his father?
_R_Pedant
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
_R_PETRUCHIO
[To VINCENTIO] Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
_R_Pedant
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
_D_Re-enter BIONDELLO
_R_BIONDELLO
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
_R_VINCENTIO
[Seeing BIONDELLO]
Come hither, crack-hemp.
_R_BIONDELLO
Hope I may choose, sir.
_R_VINCENTIO
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
_R_BIONDELLO
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.
_R_VINCENTIO
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?
_R_BIONDELLO
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.
_R_VINCENTIO
Is't so, indeed.
_D_Beats BIONDELLO
_R_BIONDELLO
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
_D_Exit
_R_Pedant
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
_D_Exit from above
_R_PETRUCHIO
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.
_D_They retire
_D_Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants
_R_TRANIO
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
_R_VINCENTIO
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.
_R_TRANIO
How now! what's the matter?
_R_BAPTISTA
What, is the man lunatic?
_R_TRANIO
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
_R_VINCENTIO
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
_R_BAPTISTA
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?
_R_VINCENTIO
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.
_R_Pedant
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
_R_VINCENTIO
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
_R_TRANIO
Call forth an officer.
_D_Enter one with an Officer
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
_R_VINCENTIO
Carry me to the gaol!
_R_GREMIO
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
_R_BAPTISTA
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
_R_GREMIO
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.
_R_Pedant
Swear, if thou darest.
_R_GREMIO
Nay, I dare not swear it.
_R_TRANIO
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
_R_GREMIO
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
_R_BAPTISTA
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
_R_VINCENTIO
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!
_D_Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
_R_BIONDELLO
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.
_R_LUCENTIO
[Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father.
_R_VINCENTIO
Lives my sweet son?
_D_Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be
_R_BIANCA
Pardon, dear father.
_R_BAPTISTA
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?
_R_LUCENTIO
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
_R_GREMIO
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
_R_VINCENTIO
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
_R_BIANCA
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
_R_LUCENTIO
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
_R_VINCENTIO
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.
_R_BAPTISTA
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?
_R_VINCENTIO
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
_D_Exit
_R_BAPTISTA
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
_D_Exit
_R_LUCENTIO
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
_D_Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
_R_GREMIO
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
_D_Exit
_R_KATHARINA
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
_R_PETRUCHIO
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
_R_KATHARINA
What, in the midst of the street?
_R_PETRUCHIO
What, art thou ashamed of me?
_R_KATHARINA
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
_R_KATHARINA
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.
_D_Exeunt
