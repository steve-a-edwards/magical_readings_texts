_S_SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
_D_Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants
_R_BAPTISTA
[To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the
'pointed day.
That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? what mockery will it be,
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
_R_KATHARINA
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'
_R_TRANIO
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
_R_KATHARINA
Would Katharina had never seen him though!
_D_Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
_R_BAPTISTA
Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
_D_Enter BIONDELLO
_R_BIONDELLO
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!
_R_BAPTISTA
Is it new and old too? how may that be?
_R_BIONDELLO
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
_R_BAPTISTA
Is he come?
_R_BIONDELLO
Why, no, sir.
_R_BAPTISTA
What then?
_R_BIONDELLO
He is coming.
_R_BAPTISTA
When will he be here?
_R_BIONDELLO
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
_R_TRANIO
But say, what to thine old news?
_R_BIONDELLO
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
_R_BAPTISTA
Who comes with him?
_R_BIONDELLO
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
_R_TRANIO
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
_R_BAPTISTA
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
_R_BIONDELLO
Why, sir, he comes not.
_R_BAPTISTA
Didst thou not say he comes?
_R_BIONDELLO
Who? that Petruchio came?
_R_BAPTISTA
Ay, that Petruchio came.
_R_BIONDELLO
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, that's all one.
_R_BIONDELLO
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.
_D_Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
_R_PETRUCHIO
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
_R_BAPTISTA
You are welcome, sir.
_R_PETRUCHIO
And yet I come not well.
_R_BAPTISTA
And yet you halt not.
_R_TRANIO
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
_R_TRANIO
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
_R_PETRUCHIO
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
_R_TRANIO
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
_R_BAPTISTA
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
_D_Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
_R_TRANIO
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.
_R_BAPTISTA
I'll after him, and see the event of this.
_D_Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants
_R_TRANIO
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
_R_LUCENTIO
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
_R_TRANIO
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
_D_Re-enter GREMIO
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
_R_GREMIO
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
_R_TRANIO
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
_R_GREMIO
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
_R_TRANIO
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
_R_GREMIO
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
_R_TRANIO
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
_R_GREMIO
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
_R_TRANIO
What said the wench when he rose again?
_R_GREMIO
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
_D_Music
_D_Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train
_R_PETRUCHIO
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
_R_BAPTISTA
Is't possible you will away to-night?
_R_PETRUCHIO
I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
_R_TRANIO
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
_R_PETRUCHIO
It may not be.
_R_GREMIO
Let me entreat you.
_R_PETRUCHIO
It cannot be.
_R_KATHARINA
Let me entreat you.
_R_PETRUCHIO
I am content.
_R_KATHARINA
Are you content to stay?
_R_PETRUCHIO
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
_R_KATHARINA
Now, if you love me, stay.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Grumio, my horse.
_R_GRUMIO
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
_R_KATHARINA
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
_R_PETRUCHIO
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
_R_KATHARINA
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
_R_GREMIO
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
_R_KATARINA
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.
_R_PETRUCHIO
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.
_D_Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO
_R_BAPTISTA
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
_R_GREMIO
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
_R_TRANIO
Of all mad matches never was the like.
_R_LUCENTIO
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
_R_BIANCA
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
_R_GREMIO
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
_R_BAPTISTA
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
_R_TRANIO
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
_R_BAPTISTA
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
_D_Exeunt
