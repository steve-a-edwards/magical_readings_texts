_S_SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.
_D_Enter GRUMIO
_R_GRUMIO
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
_D_Enter CURTIS
_R_CURTIS
Who is that calls so coldly?
_R_GRUMIO
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
_R_CURTIS
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
_R_GRUMIO
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
on no water.
_R_CURTIS
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
_R_GRUMIO
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.
_R_CURTIS
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
_R_GRUMIO
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
_R_CURTIS
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
_R_GRUMIO
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
_R_CURTIS
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
_R_GRUMIO
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.
_R_CURTIS
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
_R_GRUMIO
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
_R_CURTIS
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
_R_GRUMIO
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.
_R_CURTIS
How?
_R_GRUMIO
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.
_R_CURTIS
Let's ha't, good Grumio.
_R_GRUMIO
Lend thine ear.
_R_CURTIS
Here.
_R_GRUMIO
There.
_D_Strikes him
_R_CURTIS
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
_R_GRUMIO
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
_R_CURTIS
Both of one horse?
_R_GRUMIO
What's that to thee?
_R_CURTIS
Why, a horse.
_R_GRUMIO
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.
_R_CURTIS
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
_R_GRUMIO
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?
_R_CURTIS
They are.
_R_GRUMIO
Call them forth.
_R_CURTIS
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.
_R_GRUMIO
Why, she hath a face of her own.
_R_CURTIS
Who knows not that?
_R_GRUMIO
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.
_R_CURTIS
I call them forth to credit her.
_R_GRUMIO
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
_D_Enter four or five Serving-men
_R_NATHANIEL
Welcome home, Grumio!
_R_PHILIP
How now, Grumio!
_R_JOSEPH
What, Grumio!
_R_NICHOLAS
Fellow Grumio!
_R_NATHANIEL
How now, old lad?
_R_GRUMIO
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
_R_NATHANIEL
All things is ready. How near is our master?
_R_GRUMIO
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
_D_Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
_R_PETRUCHIO
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
ALL SERVING-MEN Here, here, sir; here, sir.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
_R_GRUMIO
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
_R_PETRUCHIO
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
_R_GRUMIO
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
_D_Exeunt Servants
_D_Singing
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
_D_Re-enter Servants with supper
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
_D_Sings
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
_D_Strikes him
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
_D_Enter one with water
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
_D_Strikes him
_R_KATHARINA
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
_R_PETRUCHIO
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?
_R_First Servant
Ay.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Who brought it?
_R_PETER
I.
_R_PETRUCHIO
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
_D_Throws the meat, etc,. about the stage
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
_R_KATHARINA
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
_R_PETRUCHIO
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Re-enter Servants severally
_R_NATHANIEL
Peter, didst ever see the like?
_R_PETER
He kills her in her own humour.
_D_Re-enter CURTIS
_R_GRUMIO
Where is he?
_R_CURTIS
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
_D_Exeunt
_D_Re-enter PETRUCHIO
_R_PETRUCHIO
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
_D_Exit
