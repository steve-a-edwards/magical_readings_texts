_S_SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
_D_Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
_R_BIANCA
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.
_R_KATHARINA
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
_R_BIANCA
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.
_R_KATHARINA
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
_R_BIANCA
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.
_R_KATHARINA
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
_R_BIANCA
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
_R_KATHARINA
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
_D_Strikes her
_D_Enter BAPTISTA
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
_R_KATHARINA
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
_D_Flies after BIANCA
_R_BAPTISTA
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
_D_Exit BIANCA
_R_KATHARINA
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
_D_Exit
_R_BAPTISTA
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?
_D_Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books
_R_GREMIO
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
_R_BAPTISTA
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!
_R_PETRUCHIO
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
_R_BAPTISTA
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
_R_GREMIO
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
_R_PETRUCHIO
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,
_D_Presenting HORTENSIO
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
_R_BAPTISTA
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
_R_PETRUCHIO
I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you like not of my company.
_R_BAPTISTA
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
_R_PETRUCHIO
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.
_R_BAPTISTA
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
_R_GREMIO
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
_R_PETRUCHIO
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
_R_GREMIO
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
_D_Presenting LUCENTIO
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.
_R_BAPTISTA
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
_D_To TRANIO
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
_R_TRANIO
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
_R_BAPTISTA
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
_R_TRANIO
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
_R_BAPTISTA
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
_D_Enter a Servant
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
_D_Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
_R_BAPTISTA
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
_R_PETRUCHIO
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.
_R_BAPTISTA
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
_R_BAPTISTA
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
_D_Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
_R_BAPTISTA
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
_R_HORTENSIO
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
_R_BAPTISTA
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
_R_HORTENSIO
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
_R_HORTENSIO
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
_R_BAPTISTA
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
_R_PETRUCHIO
I pray you do.
_D_Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
_D_Enter KATHARINA
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
_R_KATHARINA
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
_R_PETRUCHIO
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
_R_KATHARINA
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Why, what's a moveable?
_R_KATHARINA
A join'd-stool.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
_R_KATHARINA
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
_R_KATHARINA
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
_R_KATHARINA
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Should be! should--buzz!
_R_KATHARINA
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
_R_PETRUCHIO
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
_R_KATHARINA
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
_R_KATHARINA
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
_R_PETRUCHIO
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
_R_KATHARINA
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
_R_PETRUCHIO
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.
_R_KATHARINA
In his tongue.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Whose tongue?
_R_KATHARINA
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
_R_PETRUCHIO
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
_R_KATHARINA
That I'll try.
_D_She strikes him
_R_PETRUCHIO
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
_R_KATHARINA
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
_R_PETRUCHIO
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
_R_KATHARINA
What is your crest? a coxcomb?
_R_PETRUCHIO
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
_R_KATHARINA
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
_R_KATHARINA
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
_R_KATHARINA
There is, there is.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Then show it me.
_R_KATHARINA
Had I a glass, I would.
_R_PETRUCHIO
What, you mean my face?
_R_KATHARINA
Well aim'd of such a young one.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
_R_KATHARINA
Yet you are wither'd.
_R_PETRUCHIO
'Tis with cares.
_R_KATHARINA
I care not.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
_R_KATHARINA
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
_R_PETRUCHIO
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
_R_KATHARINA
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
_R_KATHARINA
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
_R_PETRUCHIO
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
_R_KATHARINA
A witty mother! witless else her son.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Am I not wise?
_R_KATHARINA
Yes; keep you warm.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
_D_Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
_R_BAPTISTA
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
_R_PETRUCHIO
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
_R_BAPTISTA
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
_R_KATHARINA
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
_R_KATHARINA
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
_R_GREMIO
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd first.
_R_TRANIO
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
_R_PETRUCHIO
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
_R_BAPTISTA
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
_R_GREMIO and TRANIO
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
_R_PETRUCHIO
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
_D_Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
_R_GREMIO
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
_R_BAPTISTA
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
_R_TRANIO
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
_R_BAPTISTA
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
_R_GREMIO
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
_R_TRANIO
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
_R_GREMIO
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
_R_TRANIO
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
_R_GREMIO
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
_R_TRANIO
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
_R_BAPTISTA
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
_R_GREMIO
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.
_R_TRANIO
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
_R_GREMIO
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?
_R_TRANIO
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
_R_GREMIO
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
_R_TRANIO
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
_R_BAPTISTA
I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's her dower?
_R_TRANIO
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
_R_GREMIO
And may not young men die, as well as old?
_R_BAPTISTA
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
_R_GREMIO
Adieu, good neighbour.
_D_Exit BAPTISTA
Now I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
_D_Exit
_R_TRANIO
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
_D_Exit
