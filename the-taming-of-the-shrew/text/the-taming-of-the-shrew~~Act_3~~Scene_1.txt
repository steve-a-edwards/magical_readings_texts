_S_SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
_D_Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA
_R_LUCENTIO
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
_R_HORTENSIO
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
_R_LUCENTIO
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
_R_HORTENSIO
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
_R_BIANCA
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
_R_HORTENSIO
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
_R_LUCENTIO
That will be never: tune your instrument.
_R_BIANCA
Where left we last?
_R_LUCENTIO
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
_R_BIANCA
Construe them.
_R_LUCENTIO
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the old pantaloon.
_R_HORTENSIO
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
_R_BIANCA
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
_R_LUCENTIO
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
_R_BIANCA
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.
_R_HORTENSIO
Madam, 'tis now in tune.
_R_LUCENTIO
All but the base.
_R_HORTENSIO
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
_D_Aside
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
_R_BIANCA
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
_R_LUCENTIO
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
_R_BIANCA
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
_R_HORTENSIO
You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.
_R_LUCENTIO
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
_D_Aside
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
_R_HORTENSIO
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
_R_BIANCA
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
_R_HORTENSIO
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
_R_BIANCA
[Reads] ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
To change true rules for old inventions.
_D_Enter a Servant
_R_Servant
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
_R_BIANCA
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
_D_Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
_R_LUCENTIO
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
_D_Exit
_R_HORTENSIO
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
_D_Exit
