_S_SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
_D_Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
_R_TRANIO
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
_R_HORTENSIO
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
_D_Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
_R_LUCENTIO
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
_R_BIANCA
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
_R_LUCENTIO
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
_R_BIANCA
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
_R_LUCENTIO
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
_R_HORTENSIO
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
_R_TRANIO
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
_R_HORTENSIO
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
_R_TRANIO
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
_R_HORTENSIO
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
_R_TRANIO
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
_R_HORTENSIO
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.
_D_Exit
_R_TRANIO
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
_R_BIANCA
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
_R_TRANIO
Mistress, we have.
_R_LUCENTIO
Then we are rid of Licio.
_R_TRANIO
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
_R_BIANCA
God give him joy!
_R_TRANIO
Ay, and he'll tame her.
_R_BIANCA
He says so, Tranio.
_R_TRANIO
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
_R_BIANCA
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
_R_TRANIO
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
_D_Enter BIONDELLO
_R_BIONDELLO
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.
_R_TRANIO
What is he, Biondello?
_R_BIONDELLO
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.
_R_LUCENTIO
And what of him, Tranio?
_R_TRANIO
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
_D_Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
_D_Enter a Pedant
_R_Pedant
God save you, sir!
_R_TRANIO
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
_R_Pedant
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
_R_TRANIO
What countryman, I pray?
_R_Pedant
Of Mantua.
_R_TRANIO
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?
_R_Pedant
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
_R_TRANIO
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
_R_Pedant
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.
_R_TRANIO
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
_R_Pedant
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
_R_TRANIO
Among them know you one Vincentio?
_R_Pedant
I know him not, but I have heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
_R_TRANIO
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
_R_BIONDELLO
[Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster,
and all one.
_R_TRANIO
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
_R_Pedant
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.
_R_TRANIO
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
_D_Exeunt
