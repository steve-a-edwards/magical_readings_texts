<h3>SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">I will, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">Before you visit him, to make inquire</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Of his behavior.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">                  My lord, I did intend it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">What company, at what expense; and finding</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">By this encompassment and drift of question</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">That they do know my son, come you more nearer</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">Than your particular demands will touch it:</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="17">Ay, very well, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="18">'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">As are companions noted and most known</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">To youth and liberty.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="26">As gaming, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">Drabbing: you may go so far.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="29">My lord, that would dishonour him.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="30">'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">You must not put another scandal on him,</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">That he is open to incontinency;</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">That they may seem the taints of liberty,</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Of general assault.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="38">But, my good lord,--</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="39">Wherefore should you do this?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="40">Ay, my lord,</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">I would know that.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="42">                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">You laying these slight sullies on my son,</a><br/>
<a NAME="45">As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</a><br/>
<a NAME="46">Your party in converse, him you would sound,</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">He closes with you in this consequence;</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">According to the phrase or the addition</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">Of man and country.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="53">Very good, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="54">And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">something: where did I leave?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="57">At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">and 'gentleman.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="59">At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</a><br/>
<a NAME="61">I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</a><br/>
<a NAME="64">There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</a><br/>
<a NAME="66">Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">See you now;</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">With windlasses and with assays of bias,</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">By indirections find directions out:</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">So by my former lecture and advice,</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="74">My lord, I have.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="75">                  God be wi' you; fare you well.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="76">Good my lord!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="77">Observe his inclination in yourself.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="78">I shall, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="79">And let him ply his music.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="80">Well, my lord.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="81">Farewell!</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit REYNALDO</i></p>
<p><i>Enter OPHELIA</i></p>
<a NAME="82">How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="83">O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">With what, i' the name of God?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="85">My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="88">Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">And with a look so piteous in purport</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">As if he had been loosed out of hell</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="93">Mad for thy love?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="94">                  My lord, I do not know;</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">But truly, I do fear it.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="96">What said he?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="97">He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</a><br/>
<a NAME="99">And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="100">He falls to such perusal of my face</a><br/>
<a NAME="101">As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</a><br/>
<a NAME="102">At last, a little shaking of mine arm</a><br/>
<a NAME="103">And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</a><br/>
<a NAME="105">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="108">He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">For out o' doors he went without their helps,</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">And, to the last, bended their light on me.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech35"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="111">Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">This is the very ecstasy of love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">Whose violent property fordoes itself</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">And leads the will to desperate undertakings</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">As oft as any passion under heaven</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</a><br/>
<a NAME="117">What, have you given him any hard words of late?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="118">No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">I did repel his fetters and denied</a><br/>
<a NAME="120">His access to me.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech37"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="121">                  That hath made him mad.</a><br/>
<a NAME="122">I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</a><br/>
<a NAME="124">And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</a><br/>
<a NAME="125">By heaven, it is as proper to our age</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</a><br/>
<a NAME="127">As it is common for the younger sort</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</a><br/>
<a NAME="129">This must be known; which, being kept close, might</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">move</a><br/>
<a NAME="131">More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
