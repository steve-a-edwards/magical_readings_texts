<h3>SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">And you must put me in your heart for friend,</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</a><br/>
<a NAME="4">That he which hath your noble father slain</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">Pursued my life.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">                  It well appears: but tell me</a><br/>
<a NAME="7">Why you proceeded not against these feats,</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">So crimeful and so capital in nature,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">You mainly were stirr'd up.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="11">O, for two special reasons;</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">My virtue or my plague, be it either which--</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">I could not but by her. The other motive,</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Why to a public count I might not go,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">Is the great love the general gender bear him;</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">Would have reverted to my bow again,</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">And not where I had aim'd them.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="27">And so have I a noble father lost;</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">A sister driven into desperate terms,</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">Stood challenger on mount of all the age</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="32">Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</a><br/>
<a NAME="34">That we can let our beard be shook with danger</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">I loved your father, and we love ourself;</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
<a NAME="38">How now! what news?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="39">Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">This to your majesty; this to the queen.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="41">From Hamlet! who brought them?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech8"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="42">Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</a><br/>
<a NAME="43">They were given me by Claudio; he received them</a><br/>
<a NAME="44">Of him that brought them.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech9"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="45">Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit Messenger</i></p>
<p><i>Reads</i></p>
<a NAME="46">'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on</a><br/>
<a NAME="47">your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see</a><br/>
<a NAME="48">your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your</a><br/>
<a NAME="49">pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden</a><br/>
<a NAME="50">and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'</a><br/>
<a NAME="51">What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</a><br/>
<a NAME="52">Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech10"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="53">Know you the hand?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech11"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="54">'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!</a><br/>
<a NAME="55">And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'</a><br/>
<a NAME="56">Can you advise me?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech12"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="57">I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</a><br/>
<a NAME="58">It warms the very sickness in my heart,</a><br/>
<a NAME="59">That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</a><br/>
<a NAME="60">'Thus didest thou.'</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech13"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="61">If it be so, Laertes--</a><br/>
<a NAME="62">As how should it be so? how otherwise?--</a><br/>
<a NAME="63">Will you be ruled by me?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech14"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="64">Ay, my lord;</a><br/>
<a NAME="65">So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech15"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="66">To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</a><br/>
<a NAME="67">As checking at his voyage, and that he means</a><br/>
<a NAME="68">No more to undertake it, I will work him</a><br/>
<a NAME="69">To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</a><br/>
<a NAME="70">Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</a><br/>
<a NAME="71">And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</a><br/>
<a NAME="72">But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</a><br/>
<a NAME="73">And call it accident.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech16"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="74">My lord, I will be ruled;</a><br/>
<a NAME="75">The rather, if you could devise it so</a><br/>
<a NAME="76">That I might be the organ.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech17"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="77">It falls right.</a><br/>
<a NAME="78">You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</a><br/>
<a NAME="79">And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</a><br/>
<a NAME="80">Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</a><br/>
<a NAME="81">Did not together pluck such envy from him</a><br/>
<a NAME="82">As did that one, and that, in my regard,</a><br/>
<a NAME="83">Of the unworthiest siege.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech18"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="84">What part is that, my lord?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech19"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="85">A very riband in the cap of youth,</a><br/>
<a NAME="86">Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</a><br/>
<a NAME="87">The light and careless livery that it wears</a><br/>
<a NAME="88">Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</a><br/>
<a NAME="89">Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</a><br/>
<a NAME="90">Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--</a><br/>
<a NAME="91">I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</a><br/>
<a NAME="92">And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</a><br/>
<a NAME="93">Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</a><br/>
<a NAME="94">And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</a><br/>
<a NAME="95">As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</a><br/>
<a NAME="96">With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</a><br/>
<a NAME="97">That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</a><br/>
<a NAME="98">Come short of what he did.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech20"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="99">A Norman was't?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech21"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="100">A Norman.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech22"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="101">Upon my life, Lamond.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech23"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="102">The very same.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech24"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="103">I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</a><br/>
<a NAME="104">And gem of all the nation.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech25"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="105">He made confession of you,</a><br/>
<a NAME="106">And gave you such a masterly report</a><br/>
<a NAME="107">For art and exercise in your defence</a><br/>
<a NAME="108">And for your rapier most especially,</a><br/>
<a NAME="109">That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</a><br/>
<a NAME="110">If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</a><br/>
<a NAME="111">He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</a><br/>
<a NAME="112">If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</a><br/>
<a NAME="113">Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</a><br/>
<a NAME="114">That he could nothing do but wish and beg</a><br/>
<a NAME="115">Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</a><br/>
<a NAME="116">Now, out of this,--</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech26"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="117">What out of this, my lord?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech27"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="118">Laertes, was your father dear to you?</a><br/>
<a NAME="119">Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</a><br/>
<a NAME="120">A face without a heart?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech28"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="121">Why ask you this?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech29"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="122">Not that I think you did not love your father;</a><br/>
<a NAME="123">But that I know love is begun by time;</a><br/>
<a NAME="124">And that I see, in passages of proof,</a><br/>
<a NAME="125">Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</a><br/>
<a NAME="126">There lives within the very flame of love</a><br/>
<a NAME="127">A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</a><br/>
<a NAME="128">And nothing is at a like goodness still;</a><br/>
<a NAME="129">For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</a><br/>
<a NAME="130">Dies in his own too much: that we would do</a><br/>
<a NAME="131">We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</a><br/>
<a NAME="132">And hath abatements and delays as many</a><br/>
<a NAME="133">As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</a><br/>
<a NAME="134">And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</a><br/>
<a NAME="135">That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--</a><br/>
<a NAME="136">Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</a><br/>
<a NAME="137">To show yourself your father's son in deed</a><br/>
<a NAME="138">More than in words?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech30"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="139">To cut his throat i' the church.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech31"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="140">No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</a><br/>
<a NAME="141">Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</a><br/>
<a NAME="142">Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</a><br/>
<a NAME="143">Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</a><br/>
<a NAME="144">We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</a><br/>
<a NAME="145">And set a double varnish on the fame</a><br/>
<a NAME="146">The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</a><br/>
<a NAME="147">And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</a><br/>
<a NAME="148">Most generous and free from all contriving,</a><br/>
<a NAME="149">Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</a><br/>
<a NAME="150">Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</a><br/>
<a NAME="151">A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</a><br/>
<a NAME="152">Requite him for your father.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech32"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="153">I will do't:</a><br/>
<a NAME="154">And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</a><br/>
<a NAME="155">I bought an unction of a mountebank,</a><br/>
<a NAME="156">So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</a><br/>
<a NAME="157">Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</a><br/>
<a NAME="158">Collected from all simples that have virtue</a><br/>
<a NAME="159">Under the moon, can save the thing from death</a><br/>
<a NAME="160">That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</a><br/>
<a NAME="161">With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</a><br/>
<a NAME="162">It may be death.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech33"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="163">                  Let's further think of this;</a><br/>
<a NAME="164">Weigh what convenience both of time and means</a><br/>
<a NAME="165">May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</a><br/>
<a NAME="166">And that our drift look through our bad performance,</a><br/>
<a NAME="167">'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</a><br/>
<a NAME="168">Should have a back or second, that might hold,</a><br/>
<a NAME="169">If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</a><br/>
<a NAME="170">We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</a><br/>
<a NAME="171">When in your motion you are hot and dry--</a><br/>
<a NAME="172">As make your bouts more violent to that end--</a><br/>
<a NAME="173">And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</a><br/>
<a NAME="174">A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</a><br/>
<a NAME="175">If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</a><br/>
<a NAME="176">Our purpose may hold there.</a><br/>
<p><i>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE</i></p>
<a NAME="177">How now, sweet queen!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech34"><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="178">One woe doth tread upon another's heel,</a><br/>
<a NAME="179">So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech35"><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="180">Drown'd! O, where?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech36"><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="181">There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</a><br/>
<a NAME="182">That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;</a><br/>
<a NAME="183">There with fantastic garlands did she come</a><br/>
<a NAME="184">Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</a><br/>
<a NAME="185">That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</a><br/>
<a NAME="186">But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</a><br/>
<a NAME="187">There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</a><br/>
<a NAME="188">Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;</a><br/>
<a NAME="189">When down her weedy trophies and herself</a><br/>
<a NAME="190">Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</a><br/>
<a NAME="191">And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</a><br/>
<a NAME="192">Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</a><br/>
<a NAME="193">As one incapable of her own distress,</a><br/>
<a NAME="194">Or like a creature native and indued</a><br/>
<a NAME="195">Unto that element: but long it could not be</a><br/>
<a NAME="196">Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</a><br/>
<a NAME="197">Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay</a><br/>
<a NAME="198">To muddy death.</a><br/>
