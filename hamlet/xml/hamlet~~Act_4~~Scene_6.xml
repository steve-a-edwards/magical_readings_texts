</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="2">Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="3">Let them come in.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exit Servant</i></p>
<a NAME="4">I do not know from what part of the world</a><br/>
<a NAME="5">I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.</a><br/>

<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Let him bless thee too.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>First Sailor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="8">He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">let to know it is.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="12">[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked</a><br/>
<a NAME="13">this, give these fellows some means to the king:</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">have words to speak in thine ear will make thee</a><br/>
<a NAME="25">dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">the matter. These good fellows will bring thee</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">course for England: of them I have much to tell</a><br/>
<a NAME="29">thee. Farewell.</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">Come, I will make you way for these your letters;</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">And do't the speedier, that you may direct me</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">To him from whom you brought them.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
