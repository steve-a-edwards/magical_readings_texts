<h3>SCENE I. A room in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</i>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech1"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="1">There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:</a><br/>
<a NAME="2">You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.</a><br/>
<a NAME="3">Where is your son?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech2"><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="4">Bestow this place on us a little while.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i></p>
<a NAME="5">Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech3"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="6">What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech4"><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="7">Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</a><br/>
<a NAME="8">Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</a><br/>
<a NAME="9">Behind the arras hearing something stir,</a><br/>
<a NAME="10">Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'</a><br/>
<a NAME="11">And, in this brainish apprehension, kills</a><br/>
<a NAME="12">The unseen good old man.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech5"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="13">O heavy deed!</a><br/>
<a NAME="14">It had been so with us, had we been there:</a><br/>
<a NAME="15">His liberty is full of threats to all;</a><br/>
<a NAME="16">To you yourself, to us, to every one.</a><br/>
<a NAME="17">Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?</a><br/>
<a NAME="18">It will be laid to us, whose providence</a><br/>
<a NAME="19">Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,</a><br/>
<a NAME="20">This mad young man: but so much was our love,</a><br/>
<a NAME="21">We would not understand what was most fit;</a><br/>
<a NAME="22">But, like the owner of a foul disease,</a><br/>
<a NAME="23">To keep it from divulging, let it feed</a><br/>
<a NAME="24">Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech6"><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="25">To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:</a><br/>
<a NAME="26">O'er whom his very madness, like some ore</a><br/>
<a NAME="27">Among a mineral of metals base,</a><br/>
<a NAME="28">Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.</a><br/>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="speech7"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="29">O Gertrude, come away!</a><br/>
<a NAME="30">The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</a><br/>
<a NAME="31">But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed</a><br/>
<a NAME="32">We must, with all our majesty and skill,</a><br/>
<a NAME="33">Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</a><br/>
<p><i>Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i></p>
<a NAME="34">Friends both, go join you with some further aid:</a><br/>
<a NAME="35">Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</a><br/>
<a NAME="36">And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:</a><br/>
<a NAME="37">Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body</a><br/>
<a NAME="38">Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i></p>
<a NAME="39">Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;</a><br/>
<a NAME="40">And let them know, both what we mean to do,</a><br/>
<a NAME="41">And what's untimely done. O, come away!</a><br/>
<a NAME="42">My soul is full of discord and dismay.</a><br/>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
