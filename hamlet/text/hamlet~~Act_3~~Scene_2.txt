_S_SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
_D_Enter HAMLET and Players
_R_HAMLET
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
_R_First Player
I warrant your honour.
_R_HAMLET
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
_R_First Player
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.
_R_HAMLET
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
_D_Exeunt Players
_D_Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
And the queen too, and that presently.
_R_HAMLET
Bid the players make haste.
_D_Exit POLONIUS
Will you two help to hasten them?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
_R_GUILDENSTERN
We will, my lord.
_D_Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
_R_HAMLET
What ho! Horatio!
_D_Enter HORATIO
_R_HORATIO
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
_R_HAMLET
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
_R_HORATIO
O, my dear lord,--
_R_HAMLET
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
_R_HORATIO
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
_R_HAMLET
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.
_D_Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
_R_HAMLET
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.
_R_HAMLET
No, nor mine now.
_D_To POLONIUS
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
_R_HAMLET
What did you enact?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus killed me.
_R_HAMLET
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
_R_QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
_R_HAMLET
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
_R_LORD POLONIUS
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
_R_HAMLET
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
_D_Lying down at OPHELIA's feet
_R_OPHELIA
No, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
I mean, my head upon your lap?
_R_OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
Do you think I meant country matters?
_R_OPHELIA
I think nothing, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
_R_OPHELIA
What is, my lord?
_R_HAMLET
Nothing.
_R_OPHELIA
You are merry, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
Who, I?
_R_OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
_R_OPHELIA
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
_D_Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters
_D_Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love
_D_Exeunt
_R_OPHELIA
What means this, my lord?
_R_HAMLET
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
_R_OPHELIA
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
_D_Enter Prologue
_R_HAMLET
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.
_R_OPHELIA
Will he tell us what this show meant?
_R_HAMLET
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
_R_OPHELIA
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
_R_Prologue
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.
_D_Exit
_R_HAMLET
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
_R_OPHELIA
'Tis brief, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
As woman's love.
_D_Enter two Players, King and Queen
_R_Player King
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
_R_Player Queen
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
_R_Player King
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--
_R_Player Queen
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
_R_HAMLET
[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
_R_Player Queen
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.
_R_Player King
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
_R_Player Queen
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
_R_HAMLET
If she should break it now!
_R_Player King
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.
_D_Sleeps
_R_Player Queen
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!
_D_Exit
_R_HAMLET
Madam, how like you this play?
_R_QUEEN GERTRUDE
The lady protests too much, methinks.
_R_HAMLET
O, but she'll keep her word.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
_R_HAMLET
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
What do you call the play?
_R_HAMLET
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.
_D_Enter LUCIANUS
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
_R_OPHELIA
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
could see the puppets dallying.
_R_OPHELIA
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
_R_HAMLET
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
_R_OPHELIA
Still better, and worse.
_R_HAMLET
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
_R_LUCIANUS
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
_D_Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears
_R_HAMLET
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
_R_OPHELIA
The king rises.
_R_HAMLET
What, frighted with false fire!
_R_QUEEN GERTRUDE
How fares my lord?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
Give o'er the play.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Give me some light: away!
_R_All
Lights, lights, lights!
_D_Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO
_R_HAMLET
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
_R_HORATIO
Half a share.
_R_HAMLET
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very--pajock.
_R_HORATIO
You might have rhymed.
_R_HAMLET
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
_R_HORATIO
Very well, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
_R_HORATIO
I did very well note him.
_R_HAMLET
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!
_D_Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
_R_GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
_R_HAMLET
Sir, a whole history.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
The king, sir,--
_R_HAMLET
Ay, sir, what of him?
_R_GUILDENSTERN
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
_R_HAMLET
With drink, sir?
_R_GUILDENSTERN
No, my lord, rather with choler.
_R_HAMLET
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.
_R_HAMLET
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.
_R_HAMLET
You are welcome.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.
_R_HAMLET
Sir, I cannot.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
What, my lord?
_R_HAMLET
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.
_R_HAMLET
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go to bed.
_R_HAMLET
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you once did love me.
_R_HAMLET
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.
_R_HAMLET
Sir, I lack advancement.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?
_R_HAMLET
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.
_D_Re-enter Players with recorders
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?
_R_GUILDENSTERN
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
_R_HAMLET
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
this pipe?
_R_GUILDENSTERN
My lord, I cannot.
_R_HAMLET
I pray you.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
Believe me, I cannot.
_R_HAMLET
I do beseech you.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
I know no touch of it, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
_R_GUILDENSTERN
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.
_R_HAMLET
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
_D_Enter POLONIUS
God bless you, sir!
_R_LORD POLONIUS
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.
_R_HAMLET
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
_R_HAMLET
Methinks it is like a weasel.
_R_LORD POLONIUS
It is backed like a weasel.
_R_HAMLET
Or like a whale?
_R_LORD POLONIUS
Very like a whale.
_R_HAMLET
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
_R_LORD POLONIUS
I will say so.
_R_HAMLET
By and by is easily said.
_D_Exit POLONIUS
Leave me, friends.
_D_Exeunt all but HAMLET
Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
_D_Exit
