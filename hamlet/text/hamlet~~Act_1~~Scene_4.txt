_S_SCENE IV. The platform.
_D_Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
_R_HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
_R_HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
_R_HAMLET
What hour now?
_R_HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve.
_R_HAMLET
No, it is struck.
_R_HORATIO
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What does this mean, my lord?
_D_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
_R_HAMLET
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
_R_HORATIO
Is it a custom?
_R_HAMLET
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
_R_HORATIO
Look, my lord, it comes!
_D_Enter Ghost
_R_HAMLET
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
_D_Ghost beckons HAMLET
_R_HORATIO
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
_R_MARCELLUS
Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
_R_HORATIO
No, by no means.
_R_HAMLET
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
_R_HORATIO
Do not, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
_R_HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
_R_HAMLET
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
_R_MARCELLUS
You shall not go, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
Hold off your hands.
_R_HORATIO
Be ruled; you shall not go.
_R_HAMLET
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
_D_Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
_R_HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination.
_R_MARCELLUS
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
_R_HORATIO
Have after. To what issue will this come?
_R_MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
_R_HORATIO
Heaven will direct it.
_R_MARCELLUS
Nay, let's follow him.
_D_Exeunt
