_S_SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
_D_Enter HAMLET
_R_HAMLET
Safely stowed.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ:
_R_GUILDENSTERN:
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
_R_HAMLET
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
_D_Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
_R_HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
_R_HAMLET
Do not believe it.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what?
_R_HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
_R_HAMLET
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
I understand you not, my lord.
_R_HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
_R_HAMLET
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
_R_GUILDENSTERN
A thing, my lord!
_R_HAMLET
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
_D_Exeunt
