_S_SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
_D_Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
_D_Enter ROSENCRANTZ
How now! what hath befall'n?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
But where is he?
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Bring him before us.
_R_ROSENCRANTZ
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
_D_Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
_R_HAMLET
At supper.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
At supper! where?
_R_HAMLET
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Alas, alas!
_R_HAMLET
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
What dost you mean by this?
_R_HAMLET
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Where is Polonius?
_R_HAMLET
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Go seek him there.
_D_To some Attendants
_R_HAMLET
He will stay till ye come.
_D_Exeunt Attendants
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.
_R_HAMLET
For England!
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Ay, Hamlet.
_R_HAMLET
Good.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
_R_HAMLET
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
_R_HAMLET
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
_D_Exit
_R_KING CLAUDIUS
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
_D_Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
_D_Exit
